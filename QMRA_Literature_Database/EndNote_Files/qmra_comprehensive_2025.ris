AB  - The reuse of wastewater in agriculture on a single-family scale presents a series of challenges regarding operation, maintenance, and sanitary safety. The present study therefore aimed to assess the potential microbiological risks to which users of a variant of septic tank (biodigester septic tank, BST) are exposed when using this system for treating blackwater (wastewater from toilets) and to propose control measures using the quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) methodology. This methodology entailed mapping the routes of exposure and calculating the probabilistic infection risk of E. coli. The results indicated that there is a microbiological health risk associated with the BST maintenance and usage. It was proposed that the fresh bovine feces addition for system maintenance should be stopped and that the reuse of the effluent for agricultural purposes should be reused via subsurface irrigation. It is therefore vital to exercise caution and implement a risk management strategy in order to ensure the safe dissemination of this technology in Brazil and Latin America.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Linezolid (LZD), a commonly used antimicrobial agent in clinical practice, has not undergone adequate pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment in pediatric populations with renal impairment (RI). Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling provides unique benefits for investigating drug pharmacokinetics in specific patient groups. This study aimed to employ the PBPK model to refine and optimize the therapeutic dosing protocol of LZD for RI pediatric patients. METHODS: The model was developed and validated for both healthy adults and RI adults, which was subsequently adapted for pediatric applications. Upon verification of the pediatric Based on clinical PK data and real-world study findings, the PBPK model demonstrated precise prediction of LZD exposure in pediatric populations with varying degrees of RI, encompassing weight- and age-associated PK variations. RESULTS: The PBPK modeling simulations exhibited robust agreement with observational data for LZD across both oral and intravenous delivery routes under diverse dosing protocols, as evidenced by the fold error (FE) always between 0.5 and 2 times, geometric mean fold error (GMFE) was less than 2.0 and mean absolute prediction error (MAPE) was within 100%. Pediatric populations with severe or end-stage RI exhibited 1.21-fold and 1.28-fold elevations in plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) values, respectively, relative to healthy pediatric counterparts when administered equivalent 10 mg/kg LZD doses. Pharmacodynamic analysis confirmed that the proposed dosing regimens-8 mg/kg every 8 hours for children with severe or end-stage RI -were effective in achieving the target AUC CONCLUSION: Our model provides a predictive instrument to enhance precision in determining therapeutic LZD dosage regimens for pediatric populations through systematic integration of developmental PK parameters.

AB  - Predicting bacterial behavior and strain variability is essential for quantitative microbial risk assessments in food safety. The growing availability of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data enables deeper insights into microbial thermotolerance. However, capturing the reduction behavior of Campylobacter jejuni during thermal inactivation, while accounting for strain variability, remains challenging. We aimed to develop a machine-learning model leveraging amino acid phylogenetic information from WGS data to predict the reduction behavior and strain variability of C. jejuni during thermal inactivation. We developed a machine learning model utilizing 38 complete genomes of C. jejuni and their parameters of modified Weibull models describing the reduction behaviors heated at 55 °C. Correlation analyses identified genes that could be relevant to thermotolerance and highlighted genes potentially linked to thermotolerance. Leave-one-out cross-validation yielded a root mean square error of 0.83 log. Strain variability was further estimated using 679 genomes from genomic databases. Strain variability exhibited a multimodal distribution with one prominent peak and three minor peaks, indicating that traditional unimodal distributions could not fully represent the variability in C. jejuni thermal reduction. The machine-learning model effectively predicted reduction behavior and strain variability of C. jejuni during thermal inactivation using WGS data. Nonetheless, its prediction range is limited by the diversity of the training set, suggesting that broader genomic datasets could enhance accuracy. These findings provide a pathway for improved microbial risk assessments through genomic data integration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gouty arthritis (GA) is a common joint inflammation closely related to hyperuricemia and urate crystal deposition, and its incidence is on the rise worldwide. Allicin, the primary biologically active component found in freshly crushed garlic extracts, has been reported to possess many beneficial biological functions. METHODS: An animal model was used to evaluate the efficacy of allicin on GA rats, and 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomics were used to explore changes in the gut microbiota and metabolites. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) used to explore the mechanism of allicin treating GA. RESULTS: The results showed that allicin effectively improved the general state of GA rats, inhibited XOD activity, and significantly reduced ROS production and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby exerting therapeutic efficacy to protect the kidneys and joints. Examination of the gut microbiota showed that the composition of the gut microbiota of GA rats improved after allicin treatment (increase in  CONCLUSION: This study highlights allicin as a promising therapeutic candidate for GA, emphasizing its potential to inhibit oxidative stress and inflammatory responses by regulating the gut-joint axis.

AB  - Poultry processing establishments play a critical role in mitigating Campylobacter contamination; a leading bacterial pathogen linked to poultry associated gastrointestinal illnesses in the United States. Quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRA), suggest that reducing Campylobacter loads during processing can significantly mitigate public health risks. However, existing QMRAs often exclude contamination levels from cut-up parts and comminuted poultry products in their exposure assessments. To address this gap, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to estimate Campylobacter concentrations on whole birds, cut-up parts, and comminuted products, with and without interventions.

AB  - The mechanisms by which antibiotics affect floc sludge-based partial nitritation-anammox (PN/A) systems remain unclear. This study investigated the dose-response relationships and microbial adaptation mechanisms of the PN/A system under antibiotic exposure. Results demonstrated that the core nitrogen removal pathway of the PN/A system persisted, despite antibiotic-induced metabolic deceleration and biomass reduction. The floc sludge-based system exhibited resilience by recovering from low-dose antibiotic stress (10-100 μg/L) and even achieving enhanced nitrogen removal under high-dose exposure (200-1000 μg/L). This resilience was supported by three microbial strategies: (i) adaptive evolution dominated by Proteobacteria; (ii) enhanced interaction networks, as indicated by greater network complexity, calcium signaling pathway, two-component systems, and cell motility; and (iii) strengthened secretion systems for self-protection through elevated ABC transporters and biofilm formation. This study deciphers adaptive mechanisms of floc sludge-based PN/A systems to antibiotics and provides a scientific basis for their application in environments with fluctuating antibiotic stress.

AB  - A series of thiophene-expanded tricyclic nucleosides featuring modifications not previously investigated, including sugar and nucleobase modifications, were synthesized as potential antiviral therapeutics. In addition, their corresponding prodrugs were also pursued to probe their potential antiviral activity, as typically prodrugs increase solubility and delivery. Initial interest was focused on ribose analogues as we had previously only synthesized a few compounds, and none had been tested against new viruses, particularly those of pandemic concern. In that regard, CEM-007, showed promising antiviral activity against several viral families. Given this promising lead, the 2'-α-fluoro-2'-β-methyl-modified analogues of CEM-007 were also synthesized for comparison. While 2'-modified analogue CEM-024 showed little to no antiviral activity, several of its prodrugs including CEM-042, CEM-052, CEM-053, CEM-054 and CEM-055, exhibited potent, broad-spectrum antiviral activity across several viral families including flaviviruses, filoviruses, and coronaviruses, with EC

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB), especially in its drug-resistant form, remains a critical public health challenge in sub-Saharan Africa, where conventional airborne transmission has been well-characterized. However, wastewater systems prevalent across urban centres may serve as overlooked environmental reservoirs for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, posing occupational and environmental health risks. Despite this, the health implications of wastewater exposure remain underexplored, particularly in high TB-burden settings. To address this research gap, we applied the Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) framework, incorporating Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), to assess the health risks of exposure to drug-resistant TB pathogens in wastewater. Our study uniquely focuses on three exposure scenarios: untreated wastewater at the head of works, aerosols from aeration tanks, and reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation, across six African countries: Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Cameroon, and South Africa. The study found the highest concentrations of M. tuberculosis in Ghana, with rifampicin-resistant strains present at lower levels across all countries. Infection risks ranged from 3 % to 100 %, with irrigation posing the highest median infection risk (0.77). The greatest disease burdens were observed at the head of works (112.46 DALYs) and during irrigation (105.31 DALYs). Our findings highlight wastewater as a significant and previously underestimated route for TB transmission. This study underscores the urgent need for enhanced treatment technologies, occupational safety protocols, and environmental surveillance. Integrating wastewater-based epidemiology into national TB monitoring could provide a valuable early-warning system, especially in regions reusing wastewater for agriculture, and may significantly strengthen global TB control strategies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use quantitative magnetic resonance angiography (qMRA) to investigate the haemodynamic influences on cerebral circulation after hybrid thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). METHODS: Between January 2016 and October 2019, zone 1 and 2 TEVAR with supra-arch rerouting procedure in extra-anatomical fashion was performed in 24 patients (mean age 72.9 ± 11.7 years) and hybrid total arch replacement (TAR) was performed in eight patients (mean age 72.0 ± 8.5 years), all of whom underwent qMRA before and after the procedure. Degenerative and dissected aneurysms were observed in 23 and nine cases, respectively. Blood flow in the internal carotid artery (ICA) and vertebral artery (VA) was measured using qMRA. The anterior and posterior cerebral circulation flows were defined as the sum of bilateral ICA and VA flows, respectively. Total intracranial blood flow (TICF) was defined as the sum of anterior and posterior cerebral circulation flows. The pre- and post-operative values of these parameters were compared for each procedure. RESULTS: Zone 1 and 2 TEVAR caused no significant post-operative differences in TICF or anterior and posterior cerebral circulation. The right VA flow increased statistically significantly after zone 1 and 2 TEVAR (median [interquartile range] 68.0 mL/min [36.8, 95.5] vs. 110.5 mL/min [76.0, 159.5] mL/min; p < .001), whereas the left VA flow decreased statistically significantly (median [interquartile range] 92.0 mL/min [60.3, 107.0] vs. 39.0 mL/min [19.3, 81.0]; p < .001). The post-operative ICA flow was maintained at the pre-operative level after all procedures. The hybrid TAR group showed no significant post-operative differences in TICF or anterior and posterior cerebral circulation. The post-operative distribution of each branch flow was also not significantly different from the pre-operative distribution. CONCLUSION: Although VA flow showed a disproportionate distribution in the posterior circulation after zone 1 and 2 TEVAR, TICF remained comparable with the pre-operative level after both zone 1 and 2 TEVAR and TAR.

AB  - Invasive Candidiasis infections are a clinical challenge, with limited effective therapeutic agents and increasing resistance. The discovery of new antifungal agents is urgently required. Here, we developed a new series of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (Menadione) Tethered to 1H-1,2,3-triazolyl-selenoester in good yields, which exhibit antifungal potential activity against Candida species. Antifungal and antibiofilm activities for the twenty-one compounds were performed in vitro against Candida spp and exhibited inhibitory effects at different concentrations for several Candida species. Two compounds showed strong inhibitory effects, with fungicidal activity at 16 and 32 μg/mL, respectively, against planktonic cells and biofilms of Candida glabrata. In silico studies were conducted to determine the binding energies against BonFIRE spectral images of antifungal protein targets, and provided stereo electronic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological profiles. The analysis through molecular docking with CYP51 and Hsp90 highlighted the inhibitory potential of the compounds in comparison to itraconazole and radicicol, and further underscored the favorable pharmacokinetic profile for all molecules, characterized by a low toxicity profile. We therefore concluded that two compounds especially exhibited potent antifungal activity against C. glabrata.

AB  - Nitazoxanide (NTZ), an FDA-approved drug, served as the framework for synthesizing 22 new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents from 4-aminosalicylic acid via protection-deprotection, Staudinger reduction, Clauson-Kaas pyrrole synthesis, and nucleophilic substitution. These compounds were evaluated for antibacterial, antimycobacterial, and antitrypanosomal activities. Several compounds, particularly 10, 11, 13, and 22, surpassed the antibacterial activity of NTZ and its active metabolite tizoxanide (TIZ) against all tested pathogens, with MICs ranging from 1.025 to 9.81 μM. Compounds 10 and 13 were twice as potent as ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, while 11 and 17 were equipotent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC 5.34 μM). Compounds 11 and 14 matched ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 3.20 and 2.98 µM), whereas 13 and 21 were 1.5- and 2.5-fold more potent against Enterococcus faecalis, respectively. Compound 10 outperformed ciprofloxacin against Helicobacter pylori (MIC 1.025 μM). Compounds 6 (MIC 9.46 μM) and 7 (MIC 16.78 μM) outperformed NTZ against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and compound 3 emerged as a promising antitrypanosomal agent (MICs 2.59-4.73 μg/mL) against six Trypanosoma species. Cytotoxicity and pharmacokinetic studies confirmed the compounds' favorable drug-like properties and high selectivity. Docking results showed strong binding to key targets like pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase (G6PS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). Overall, several NTZ derivatives, particularly compounds 3, 6, 10, 11, 13, and 22, showed potent broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and offer convenient leads for further optimization.

AB  - With the continued upsurge of antibiotic resistance and reduced susceptibility to almost all frontline antibiotics, there is a pressing need for the development of new, effective, and safe alternatives. In this study, a scaffold-hopping strategy was utilized to develop a novel class of penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a) inhibitors, centered around a 4H-chromen-4-one core structure. These newly designed compounds demonstrated strong antibacterial efficacy against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other drug-resistant gram-positive pathogens. Notably, compounds 16 and 18-20 exhibited significant potency against the tested Staphylococcal strains, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 0.008 to 1 μg/mL, outperforming standard treatments such as vancomycin and linezolid, as well as the reference compound III. These derivatives also retained their activity against a range of clinically relevant multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria and showed no detectable cytotoxicity in human cell assays. Additionally, compounds 19 and 20 displayed synergistic effects when co-administered with β-lactam antibiotics against two MRSA strains. Finally, these derivatives exhibited excellent binding affinities to the allosteric site of PBP2a, with dissociation constants ranging from 13 to 23 μM, indicating that this novel class inhibits PBP2a as the primary target by binding non-covalently to its allosteric site, hence impairing cell-wall crosslinking, and resulting in cell death. Accordingly, the reported 4H-chromen-4-one-based class of inhibitors merit further investigation as potential therapeutic options for treatment of staphylococcal infections.

AB  - Disruption of the epidermal barrier contributes to skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, plays a key role in skin homeostasis and immune regulation. While traditionally associated with toxicity, AhR has emerged as a promising therapeutic target, particularly via tryptophan-derived indoles. To support AhR research in a dermatological context, we developed AhaRaCaT, a stable luciferase-based reporter cell line derived from human keratinocytes (HaCaT), enabling the assessment of AhR transcriptional activity in a skin-relevant model. We characterized the inducibility of AhaRaCaT in response to model AhR ligands (TCDD, BaP, FICZ) in dose- and time-dependent assays. Antagonist profiling with MNF, CH223191, GNF, carvone, and jasmone yielded IC50 values over 4- and 24-hour exposures. A panel of indoles previously studied in other models was evaluated for AhR activation, revealing a robust luciferase response at 4 h that declined at 24 h, consistent with trends observed in other cell types. Selected indoles also induced CYP1A1 mRNA expression and reversed cytokine-induced downregulation of filaggrin in HaCaT cells, highlighting their potential in mitigating inflammation-associated skin barrier defects. In summary, the AhaRaCaT cell line offers a sensitive and physiologically relevant tool for studying AhR signaling in skin, with broad applications in toxicology, dermatological research, and the development of AhR-targeted therapies for inflammatory skin diseases.

AB  - Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is an infectious disease caused by dimorphic fungi of the Paracoccidioides genus and causes a series of discomforts in affected patients. This work aimed to evaluate the antifungal potential of synthetic chalcones against Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (Pb) and to determine in silico possible therapeutic targets. An in silico evaluation of a database of 21 synthesized chalcones was carried out based on pharmacokinetic parameters, enzymatic inhibition, Tanimoto similarity, and the prediction of the spectrum of activity by PASS (prediction of activity spectra of substances). The most viable chalcones from the previous evaluation were selected for the measurement of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against Pb and for cytotoxicity assays pre- and post-metabolization using HEPG2 cells. After in silico evaluation, the compounds 4, 11, 12, 20, and 21 were selected to carry out the molecular docking and in vitro tests. In the docking studies, multiple hydrophobic and polar intermolecular interactions were observed, such as hydrogen bonds, with emphasis on compound 20 in the active site of thioredoxin, where it made 4 hydrogen bonds with the residues Gln43, Ala36, and Thr38. In vitro testing revealed antifungal activity, with the MICs ranging from 32 to 128 μg/mL. In cytotoxicity assays, the 5 compounds exhibited reduced IC

AB  - This work developed a class of unique benzopyronyl imidazolidinediones (BIs) as new structural skeleton of potential multitargeting antibacterial agents to confront dreadful Staphylococcus aureus infections. Some target compounds exhibited effective antibacterial activities against the tested strains. Especially, butyl BI 6c and 5-hydroxy BI 26d exerted excellent inhibitory activity toward Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and MRSA 43300 with a low MIC value of 0.5 and 0.25 μg/mL, being 2- and 4-fold more active than norfloxacin, respectively. BIs 6c and 26d displayed inconspicuous hemolytic rates and good pharmacokinetics. Moreover, BIs 6c and 26d could effectively inhibit and eliminate bacterial biofilms and block the development of resistance. Preliminary mechanistic investigations revealed that BIs 6c and 26d could trigger bacterial oxidative stress, intercalate into DNA, and bind with DNA gyrase B, which showed multitargeting antibacterial potential. Furthermore, BI 26d displayed superior anti-MRSA 43300 efficacy to norfloxacin in vivo. These findings suggested that benzopyronyl imidazolidinediones might provide new promise as potential new structural multitargeting antibacterial candidates for the prevention and treatment of Staphylococcus aureus.

Serum pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β) decreased, contrasting with increases in immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG) and enhanced superoxide dismutase activity. Microbiota restructuring featured ruminal enrichment of Bifidobacterium and fecal dominance of Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, coupled with suppression of pro-inflammatory taxa (e.g., Christensenellaceae_R-7_group). Metabolomic analysis identified four ARWD-responsive biomarkers, notably Spirotaccagenin and Pelanin, operating through linoleic acid metabolism and phospholipase D signaling pathways. Strong correlations linked microbial shifts to improved lactation parameters and reduced inflammation. CONCLUSION: The findings establish that ARWD alleviates SCBM through coordinated microbiota remodeling and metabolic reprogramming, specifically enhancing antioxidant defenses, restoring mammary barrier integrity, and modulating immune-inflammation crosstalk, with optimal efficacy at 0.4 g·kg

AB  - Acne which is caused by Cutibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria is the most common skin problem among adolescents and young adults. Topical antibiotics like tetracycline are commonly used to treat acne but their effectiveness has declined as bacteria develop antibiotic resistance. Thus, this research emphasizes the antibacterial properties of new synthetic derivatives of halogenated xanthone and benzophenone (1a-1f), (2a-2d), (3a-3i), and (4a-4j) via in vitro antibacterial assay with tetracycline, erythromycin, and salicylic acid as reference standards. Based on the well diffusion assay (WDA), compound 1 f revealed the most potent antibacterial properties by inhibiting the acne-causing bacteria strains with a recorded inhibition zone of 15.67 ± 0.58 mm (C. acnes; ATCC 6919), 16.00 ± 0.00 mm (C. acnes; ATCC 11827), 15.00 ± 0.00 mm (S. aureus; ATCC 6538), and 30.00 ± 0.00 mm (S. aureus; ATCC 10832). These findings were further supported by the MIC and MBC values of compound 1 f, which ranged from 0.02 to 0.50 mg/mL. Next, the structure-activity relationship study revealed the attachment of different substituents at different positions that were responsible for the potent activity of compound 1 f. Compound 1 f reveals good binding affinity values towards C. acnes and S. aureus and better interaction with the protein active site. In silico study of drug-likeness and therapeutic effectiveness properties, including Lipinski's 'rule of five', Veber's rule, and ADME properties, projected that the compound 1 f would be toxicity-free, non-carcinogenic, and risk-free, which could be used as a better therapeutic agent for acne formulation with a guarantee for healthy skin.

AB  - With rising antimicrobial resistance and continuous failure of conventional therapies, innovative drug development against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is crucial for effective clinical treatment. Here, new dimethyl quaternary ammonium salt 5b derived from harmane were designed, exhibiting potent anti-MRSA activities including clinical strains (MIC = 0.25-0.5 μg/mL) with rapid bactericidal mode, slow resistance acquisition, favorable stability and low cytotoxicity and hemolytic toxicity. Moreover, compound 5b demonstrated effective therapeutic effects in the mouse skin infection model, being competitive compared with vancomycin. Mechanistic investigations revealed that compound 5b inhibited biofilm formation by reducing extracellular polysaccharides, damaged the structure and function of cell wall by binding to peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acids (LTA), targeted to membranes by interaction with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) accompanying with depolarization, permeability alteration and integrity damage. Especially, compound 5b could further reduce intracellular metabolic activity, disrupt the redox balance with increasing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreasing activity of glutathione (GSH) as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD). Moreover, compound 5b could bind to DNA driven by entropy and enthalpy via a spontaneous process. Overall, this work provided a prominent anti-MRSA lead candidate, managing resistant infections by multi-target mechanism.

AB  - The pursuit of novel therapeutic agents with potent anticancer activity remains a key priority in medicinal chemistry, particularly for addressing liver and stomach malignancies, which continue to present substantial clinical challenges. In this study, we have reported the synthesis and biological assessment of a new series of novel 1,4-Dihydropyridine (DHP) tethered Isatin scaffolds, aimed at identifying promising candidates with significant anticancer potential. A combined approach of in-silico ADMET analysis, molecular docking and in-vitro cytotoxic screening was employed. The ADMET predictions indicated favorable pharmacokinetic profiles and minimal toxicity for most of the compounds. Molecular docking revealed strong binding with CDK2, supporting their anticancer potential. Compounds P3, P6, P7, P10, P11, and P12 demonstrated substantial anticancer activity against HepG2 (liver cancer) and AGS (gastric cancer) cell lines when compared to cisplatin, with P11 being the most potent (IC

AB  - Understanding the dose-response (DR) relationship for infectious diseases is important for quantitative microbial risk assessment studies to mitigate risk. To capture the DR dynamics, understanding the pathogenesis of the infectious agent is desirable. Typically, attempting to understand the DR dynamics would involve within-host mathematical modelling and fitting DR curves to experimental data. No mathematical model exists that describes the within-host dynamics that occur within an individual infected with Legionnaires' disease. Further, most DR models are based either on a single-hit or threshold hypothesis for the cause of illness. Here, we derive a model to explain within-host dynamics post-infection with Legionnaires' disease that incorporates heterogeneity at the cellular and population levels. We develop a new DR model that allows for either of two hypotheses for the cause of illness, adding a new level of flexibility not currently seen in the literature. We extend the DR model to incorporate time as we develop a dose-dependent incubation-period model that is based on biological mechanisms. Our within-host models provide an ID50 of between eight and nine

AB  - Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are widely used in various fields, including medicine, food products, water filtration systems, cosmetics, textiles, and packaging, due to their powerful antimicrobial activity. However, chronic exposure to AgNPs was found to pose risks to human health owing to their highly reactive surface, large surface area, and the potential to penetrate the blood brain barrier (BBB). In this study, the effects of chronic oral administration of AgNPs on the cognitive and behavioral functions of rats were investigated, and the molecular mechanisms underlying AgNPs-induced neurotoxicity were reported. Male Wistar adult rats were orally administered doses ranging from 10 μg/kg body weight (BW) to 10 mg/kg BW/day for 90 days. Results revealed that the effects of chronic oral administration of AgNPs were dose dependent. Spatial learning, memory, and locomotor activity in rats were impaired at doses above 500 μg/kg BW/day. Significant decline in the levels of brain neurotransmitters, including serotonin and acetylcholinesterase, was observed at doses above 100 μg/kg BW/day. However, a significant reduction in dopamine levels was observed to be between 10 and 100 μg/kg BW/day, indicating that dopaminergic pathways are highly sensitive to AgNPs exposure, even at minimal concentrations. Interesentingly, increase in oxidative stress markers (ROS, protein carbonylation and MDA) at doses above 100 μg/Kg BW/day, decrease in antioxidant potential (GSH and TAC) at dose of 10 μg/Kg BW/day, induction of DNA damage (8-OHdG), and apoptosis in the brain at doses above 100 μg/Kg BW/day were observed. Furthermore, H&E staining and immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue revealed inflammation, apoptosis and alterations in brain architecture, with signs of degeneration observed at doses starting from 10 μg/kg BW/day. The presence of AgNPs was also detected in the cerebral cortex of animals receiving 2 and 5 mg/kg BW/day. The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for chronic administration of starch-coated AgNPs on brain health was determined to be 10 μg/kg BW/day, demonstrating that even low-dose, long-term exposure to AgNPs poses significant risks to the central nervous system.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the levels of lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) in orange juice samples collected from various markets in Rabat (Morocco), using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GF-AAS), and to evaluate the risk posed to consumer health. Pb was detected in 58% of samples, with concentrations ranging from 0.009 to 0.047 mg/kg and an average of 0.024 mg/kg. The incidence rates were 81.8% in pure juices, 70% in nectars, and 90% in juice concentrates. Five samples (16%) exceeded the maximum authorized limit for Pb (0.03 mg/kg) according to the standards of the European Commission, the Codex Alimentarius, and the Moroccan authorities. In the case of Cd, it was detected in 74.2% of samples, with levels ranging from 0.014 to 0.041 mg/kg (average: 0.025 mg/kg). Although no specific regulatory limit has been set for Cd in juices, the concentrations observed greatly exceeded the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) reference (0.005 mg/L) for drinking water. The non-carcinogenic risk assessment, based on hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI) values, revealed values of less than 1, indicating no significant long-term health risk. On the other hand, the carcinogenic risk (CR) and total carcinogenic risk (TCR) values for Cd exceeded the acceptable threshold of 1 × 10

AB  - Lugdunin, a newly discovered antibiotic with a unique structure, emerged during a decade-long antibiotic discovery void and is considered a promising lead for combating drug-resistant bacteria. However, its narrow spectrum targeting only Gram-positive bacteria and its structural limitations have hindered its development and clinical application. Herein, inspired by our previous combinatorial modification strategies for lugdunin, we designed and synthesized a series of multi-cationic lugdunin derivatives using a biphenylmethyl modification on the tryptophan indole structure combined with multi-cationic amino acid mutations, aiming to expand its antimicrobial spectrum. Our results showed that the optimized derivative, Lug-15, exhibited strong antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Lug-15 rapidly kills bacteria primarily through membrane disruption and had a very low propensity to induce bacterial resistance. Additionally, it demonstrated low hemolytic toxicity and significant therapeutic potential in various infection models, including keratitis caused by MRSA and P. aeruginosa, MRSA-induced pneumonia, thigh muscle infection, and wound infection, indicating Lug-15's broad-spectrum therapeutic potential. Therefore, this study overcomes the historical limitation of prior SAR attempts and offers a new lead for combating drug-resistant bacteria.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae is a critical-priority pathogen based on the 2024 WHO list and poses a significant threat to human health. The methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, crucial for isoprenoid biosynthesis in many pathogenic bacteria, including K. pneumoniae, represents a promising source of targets for antibacterial drug discovery. In this study, we targeted the enzyme 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXPS) from K. pneumoniae that catalyzes the initial step of the MEP pathway and, apart from broad-spectrum thiamine analogues, has no reported inhibitors to date. We identified thienopyrimidinone 6 as a promising initial hit against KpDXPS and conducted a structure-activity relationship (SAR) exploration to enhance potency, solubility and toxicity profiles. This effort led to the development of compounds 14 and 19, which exhibit improved solubility and reduced toxicity while maintaining inhibitory activity against KpDXPS. These findings provide a strong foundation for the development of novel anti-infective agents to address infections caused by K. pneumoniae.

AB  - Blocking the membrane fusion function mediated by the S2 subunit 6-helix bundle (6-HB) structure is an effective strategy for treating coronavirus infections. However, the 6-HB structure of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) remains unclear, hindering the development of targeted drugs. In this study, we predicted the 6-HB structure of IBV via in silico and designed an antiviral peptide HR2P based on this structure. This peptide, derived from a conserved HR2 domain identified via amino acid sequence alignment of 511 IBV strains, disrupted IBV-mediated intercellular membrane fusion. The inhibition results demonstrated that HR2P had broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against different IBV strains representing four dominant genotypes in vitro, reducing viral proliferation and replication by 100- to 1000-fold. Notably, the most potent suppression was observed against the IBV Sczy3 strain of the predominant GI-19 genotype. Meanwhile, in vivo treatment with HR2P effectively mitigated IBV infection and reduced horizontal transmission capacity, as evidenced by reduced morbidity and mortality in IBV-infected chickens and alleviated tracheal and kidney damage. Early administration of HR2P showed superior suppression efficacy. Therefore, the HR2P peptide demonstrates potential as a targeted therapeutic agent against IBV, offering a foundation for IBV prevention strategies.

AB  - The intestinal barrier is essential for maintaining mucosal homeostasis, and its dysfunction, often mediated by aberrant nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation, is closely linked to chronic inflammation. Dietary carbohydrates modulate this barrier primarily through microbial fermentation and metabolite-mediated signaling. This review synthesized current evidence on how carbohydrate structure, including degree of polymerization, branching, and chemical modifications, influenced gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) production, and NF-κB regulation. Interestingly, glycemic carbohydrates promote barrier disruption and chronic inflammation by enhancing NF-κB activation, while nonglycemic carbohydrates such as oligosaccharides, fibers, and resistant starch strengthen the gut barrier and suppress inflammatory pathways through beneficial microbiota shifts and SCFAs production. Mechanistic insights are supported by both preclinical and emerging clinical data, although human evidence remains limited and heterogeneous in the dose-response and population outcomes. The review also highlights recent advances in carbohydrate engineering, which show promise for precision modulation of the carbohydrate-microbial metabolites-NF-κB-barrier axis. Future research directions are outlined, including the development of functional carbohydrates tailored for personalized nutrition and techno-functional hybrids. These findings support dietary strategies and functional food innovations targeting carbohydrate structure to optimize gut health and reduce inflammation-driven diseases through the precise regulation of NF-κB signaling pathways.

AB  - Pathogenic RNA viruses from various virus families represent substantial public health hazards. Specific antiviral drugs effective against most RNA virus infections have not yet been developed. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the broad-spectrum antiviral activities of phenylalanine derivatives designed by replacing the carboxylic acid moiety with various bioisosteres such as nitrile, hydroxamidine and 5-oxo/thioxo-1,2,4-oxadiazole. Novel synthesized N-(1-substituted 2-phenylethyl)-N-(3-chlorobenzyl)-2,4-dichlorobenzamides (6e, 7e, 8e and 9d), together with phenylalanine derivatives previously prepared by our group, were evaluated antiviral activities against chikungunya (CHIKV), Zika (ZIKV), parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3), and enterovirus 71 (EV71). All phenylalanine derivatives showed antiviral activities against PIV3, with the 3-fluorobenzyl substituted analogue 6d emerging as the most potent compound (IC

AB  - The rampant overuse of antibiotics has triggered widespread bacterial resistance, further exacerbated by biofilm-forming pathogens and non-mutating persisters, necessitating urgent development of novel antibiotics. Here, a series of bis-pyridinium cationic amphiphilic antimicrobial small molecules were designed and synthesized. Structure-activity relationships indicated that the hydrophobic tail chain length is crucial for the antibacterial activity. In vitro bioassay demonstrated that compound 3g exerted potent antibacterial activity (MIC

In this study, we employed recombinant VSV expressing green fluorescent protein (VSV-GFP) to evaluate 1,500 compounds from commercial and self-built compound libraries, leading to the identification of SMU-T2d as a lead compound with preliminary anti-VSV activity. Subsequent structural optimization yielded the preferred compound SMU-V18. It significantly inhibited the fluorescence intensity of VSV-GFP, viral mRNA and protein expression levels in a concentration-dependent manner, and demonstrated stable antiviral activity at different virus concentrations and administration time points.

AB  - Adaptor protein-2 associated kinase 1 (AAK1) has been proposed as a promising host target for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents. Different regioisomers, as well as scaffolds that were not explored before for their AAK1 affinity, were prepared that were derived from a known and potent 7-azaindole-based AAK1 inhibitor. This effort led to the discovery of various pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridines, pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridines and pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines with low nanomolar AAK1 binding affinity. The AAK1 data were rationalized by molecular modeling. Selected congeners displayed antiviral activity against dengue virus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus.

AB  - The indoles and benzo[c]phenanthridines have attracted much interest as potential anticancer and antibacterial agents. Herein, the synthesis and bioactivity of new and known indole-coupled dihydrobenzo[c]phenanthridines are reported. Among the investigated compounds, 2j displays potent and selective activity against drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecium strains. In addition, 1a-c and 2a specifically target the multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis G122, possibly by inhibiting the Pks13 enzyme, as deduced from the in silico analyses. Additionally, compound 1g is more potent than cisplatin against MCF-7 (breast) and PC-3 (prostate) human cancer cell lines, whereas 2b is found to be almost as active as cisplatin against PC-3 and SW-480 (colorectal) cell lines. Compounds 1a and 1g display remarkable selectivity index values, thus being promising antibacterial and anticancer hits.

AB  - Aminobenzimidazole-coumaranone conjugates, specifically 3-{[(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)amino](substitutedphenyl)methyl}benzofuran-2(3H)-ones, were synthesized through a one-pot reaction involving 2-coumaranone, aryl aldehydes, and 2-aminobenzimidazole. This reaction, catalyzed by triethylamine in acetonitrile at 80°C, achieved yields of up to 85%. Preparative liquid chromatography successfully isolated compounds 4b and 4c as two isomers with purities reaching 99.30%. Their absolute configurations, (S, R) for compound 4b and (R, S) for compound 4c, were determined using electronic circular dichroism and confirmed via TD-DFT calculations. The antimicrobial potential of the synthesized compounds (4a-j) and their enantiopure isomers (4b', 4b″, 4c', 4c″) was evaluated against the bacterial strains Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus proteolyticus, and the fungal strains Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger. Notably, compounds 4a, 4d, 4i, and 4j exhibited superior antimicrobial activity. Molecular docking studies further reinforced these results, revealing strong receptor binding affinities (-7.5 to -10.5 kcal/mol), which surpass those of standard drugs. These findings highlight the promising potential of aminobenzimidazole-coumaranone conjugates as effective antimicrobial agents.

AB  - The rise of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) has created an urgent need to discover and develop new anti-mycobacterial agents. Herein, we report the synthesis and evaluation of a library of 1,3-diaryl substituted pyrazole-based imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine carboxamides as promising anti-TB agents. In preliminary screening, 10 out of 26 compounds displayed potent in vitro inhibition against Mtb H37Rv with a MIC value of 0.03 μg/mL, which is 17-fold more potent than the first-line TB drug streptomycin, 33-fold more potent than ethambutol, and equipotent with isoniazid and rifampicin. Encouragingly, most of these compounds exhibited a selectivity index (SI) >3333.3 and CC₅₀ values >100 μg/mL against Vero cells, indicating they are over 3000 times more toxic to M. tuberculosis than to mammalian cells and demonstrate absence of cytotoxicity at concentrations effective against TB (MIC = 0.03 μg/mL). Among them, 12a, 14a, and 14d demonstrated remarkable activity against drug-resistant strains of Mtb with an MIC of 0.03 μM. Time-kill kinetic studies revealed that 12a, 14a, and 14d exhibited bacteriostatic properties. Furthermore, 12a, 14a, and 14d demonstrated synergistic effects with the FDA-approved anti-TB drugs rifampicin (ƩFIC 0.093), ethambutol (ƩFIC 0.061), and moxifloxacin (ƩFIC 0.154-0.281), exhibiting bactericidal time-kill properties in combination with these drugs. Additionally, 12a, 14a, and 14d exhibited acceptable metabolic stability (CL

AB  - Euphorbia fischeriana has been traditionally used in Chinese medicine for tuberculosis (TB) treatment since ancient times. In this study, we first report the identification of an abietane-type diterpenoid, 17-hydroxy-jolkinolide B (HJKB), from E. fischeriana, which exhibits potent antimycobacterial activity against both Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra strain and clinical isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of HJKB against diverse M. tuberculosis strains range from 1 to 12 μg/mL. Notably, HJKB demonstrates significant bactericidal activity against intracellular M. tuberculosis H37Ra in macrophage models, accompanied by anti-inflammatory effects at concentrations of 2-5 μg/mL. Using a combination of chemoproteomic analysis and pull-down assays, we explored the preliminary antimycobacterial mechanism of HJKB. Results indicate that HJKB interacts with the target proteins RpoB and RpoC in M. tuberculosis H37Ra, a finding further corroborated by molecular docking studies. RpoB and RpoC are essential subunits of the DNA-directed RNA polymerase holoenzyme, which is critical for bacterial ribosomal transcription regulation. In summary, HJKB represents a bioactive constituent of E. fischeriana with anti-TB efficacy, acting as a transcription inhibitor against M. tuberculosis. This study not only elucidates its antimycobacterial mechanism but also provides a preclinical foundation for the development of natural product-based TB therapeutics.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rural sanitation deficits in the United States represent an important source of non-point source pollution and may present risks to public health. We propose an interrupted time series analysis to measure the effect of a town-wide sanitation expansion program on the release of pathogens to the environment. This work is expected to yield valuable insight into the potential for rural sanitation improvements to reduce pathogen releases and support public health and well-being. METHODS: We will conduct a longitudinal baseline study including quantitative measurement of key enteric pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria adjacent to households lacking adequate sanitation. As households connect to a new sewerage system serving the entire community, longitudinal household sampling will continue until crossover is complete. We will include concurrent comparison sites with existing appropriate sanitation as well as sites never receiving the intervention to monitor secular trends in pathogen releases during the study period. ANALYSIS: We will compare the concentration of culturable  ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Informed consent will be obtained prior to data collection, with participants informed of study details and risks. Participation is completely voluntary, and identifiable data will be securely and separately stored from all other data. Each household will be offered a summary of their site-specific data. Deidentified results will be shared with the community in a public forum and published in peer-reviewed journals. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY: This study utilizes both molecular and culture-based environmental sampling with structured household and observational surveys to carefully assess the effects of a community-wide sanitation system on environmental contamination, infection risk, and well-being.To address potential confounding due to secular trends and/or weather-related events, we plan to include at least 10 comparison sites with existing improved sanitationinfrastructure and 10 sites with poor sanitation infrastructure not receiving the intervention during the study period.Bias will be reduced by defining enteric pathogen targets and the main statistical models prior to analysis.Although we will adjust for external trends such as temperature and rainfall, the design of an interrupted time series lacks a randomized control group, limiting the ability to fully isolate the intervention effect.Voluntary participation and required utility fees may lead to selection bias, and survey responses may be influenced by social desirability or courtesy bias. We aim to mitigate this through community engagement, confidentiality assurances, and validating survey responses with environmental testing.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study investigated the dose-dependent effects of chlormequat chloride (CC) applications on soil fungal community structure and diversity in a peanut cultivation system. METHODS: A controlled field experiment was conducted with four treatment regimes: control (CK, no CC application), low-dose (D, 45g active ingredient/ha), medium-dose (M, 75g a.i./ha), and high-dose (G, 225g a.i./ha). CC solutions were applied during critical growth phases (flowering and pod-setting stages). Rhizosphere soil samples were collected 30-days post-application for microbial analysis. Alpha diversity (e.g., Shannon index), beta diversity (community composition), and functional guild analysis of fungal communities were assessed. RESULTS: Alpha diversity assessments revealed significant concentration-dependent responses. The low-dose treatment (D) exhibited statistically higher Shannon diversity indices ( DISCUSSION: These findings establish clear dose-response relationships between CC exposure levels and fungal community parameters. The relative stability of Basidiomycota suggests enhanced tolerance to CC stress compared to Ascomycota. The significant shifts observed in key functional guilds, particularly the decline in pathogens and proliferation of saprophytes, highlight the impact of CC application on soil fungal ecological functions.

AB  - The overuse of antibiotics has led to the progressively severe issue of bacterial drug resistance. As a result, a large number of antibiotics available on the market show a notably diminished effectiveness against drug-resistant bacteria. Thus, a series of dimethylcysteamine pleuromutilin derivatives were designed and synthesized. Both in vitro and in vivo tests were conducted to evaluate their activities against bacteria. Most derivatives exhibited potent antibacterial effects against Gram - positive bacteria, and their antibacterial activities were superior to those of tiamulin. Derivative 4g showed exceptional antibacterial activity, having MIC values as low as 0.016 μg/mL. Furthermore, compared to tiamulin, it exhibited a significantly longer post-antibiotic effect (PAE) and a slower rate of resistance development. The molecular docking results of derivative 4g were excellent, and it effectively inhibited the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in bacteria. Derivative 4g exhibited extremely low cytotoxicity and had low oral acute toxicity, with an LD

AB  - Influenza is a highly contagious, acute respiratory illness caused by the influenza virus. The continual emergence of drug-resistant viral strains has created an urgent need for the development of novel anti-influenza agents. In our previous study, we identified a series of nor-sesquiterpenoids with potent activity against influenza A virus, isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces sp. XM17-an actinobacterial strain derived from fresh panda feces. Building on these findings, we synthesized the core nor-sesquiterpene scaffold and functionalized it by attaching various molecular fragments through a 1,2,3-triazole linker containing heteroatoms, utilizing a click chemistry strategy. This approach aimed to enhance antiviral potency through structural diversification. Among the resulting compounds, 14d demonstrated superior antiviral activity against the influenza virus, along with a low 50 % cytotoxic concentration. Mechanistic studies indicated that compound 14d exerted its antiviral effect during the later stages of viral infection. Notably, it did not inhibit neuraminidase activity. Instead, it disrupted the cellular nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway and suppressed the virus-induced overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines. Collectively, these results highlight compound 14d as a promising lead candidate for the development of novel therapeutics targeting influenza virus infection.

AB  - The serious threat of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections necessitates innovative and effective strategies to overcome antibiotic resistance. Although antimicrobial peptidomimetics (AMPMs) have demonstrated significant efficacy in addressing bacterial resistance, challenges such as low target selectivity and high toxicity remain. In an attempt to address such challenges, we designed a series of amidated oligopyridinium peptidomimetics that could target both bacterial membranes and DNA selectively over human cells. A lead compound, 1c, exhibited potent broad-spectrum antibacterial activity (MIC ≤2 μg/mL) and favorable biosafety. Mechanistic studies revealed that 1c binds to bacterial membrane components (phosphatidylglycerol and lipopolysaccharide), inducing membrane depolarization and perforation, while also selectively interacting with bacterial DNA, triggering ROS accumulation and metabolic suppression in bacterial cells. 1c can eradicate both dormant and persistent bacteria within 2 h and maintain efficacy in bacterial infection models involving sheep blood and mammalian cells. 1c showed no toxicity in Galleria mellonella larvae, zebrafish, or mice at 20 mg/kg. In vivo, it reduced bacterial loads, achieving 55 % survival in G. mellonella and 75 % survival in a murine MRSA infection model. This study demonstrates that the newly developed oligopyridinium derivatives are potent dual-targeting antimicrobial agents and may offer a promising strategy to combat MDR infections.

AB  - Previously, a chemical standardization method quantifying six fatty acids was established for Limnospira (formerly Arthrospira) authenticity and quality control. Since glyceroglycolipids constitute a significant source of fatty acids in Limnospira, a targeted phytochemical investigation was performed that resulted in the identification of two novel diacylated glycerol sulfoquinvosides and four known compounds. Notably, in vitro anti-influenza activity of isolated and analogous glyceroglycolipids, specifically two glyceroglycolipids, incorporating γ-linolenic acid and sulfoquinvose units tethered to a glycerol backbone, exhibited the highest anti-influenza activity. These findings suggest that the glyceroglycolipid-enriched fraction from Limnospira holds the potential for direct-acting antiviral properties.

However, it remains unclear whether the capacity of natural microbial communities to biodegrade sulfonamide is significantly stimulated above specific exposure thresholds. To investigate this, we performed a 47-day microcosm study in laboratory channels, exposing natural sediment communities to six SMZ concentrations (from C0 to C5) using an exponential dose-response design with a maximal nominal concentration of 10 mg.kg

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) prevents malnutrition in people with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, including those with cystic fibrosis (CF). We developed a lipase that is stable against proteolysis and at the pH of the fed stomach, so it can be taken during a meal to promote mixing of enzyme and substrate. We designed a dose-ranging study of ANG003, a microbial PERT combining this lipase with low pH-stable protease and amylase, also of microbial origin. METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized evaluation of ANG003 in subjects with CF, studied once without PERT and again after randomization to a single dose level of four possible combinations of lipase, protease, and amylase. We developed blood-based substrate absorption challenge tests employing DHA+EPA, whey and potato starch to determine dose-response to each of these enzymes, respectively. RESULTS: ANG003 improved DHA+EPA absorption with a statistically significant increase with 80 mg and 120 mg lipase doses compared to 20 mg (p = 0.03; p = 0.004). The absorption of total fats followed a similar pattern to DHA+EPA. There was a significant increase in absorbed amino acid equivalents, reflecting proteolysis, over no PERT in the highest (75 mg) dose of protease (p = 0.03). In subjects without diabetes, glucose was slightly lower while c-peptide levels remained unchanged with all amylase doses. Adverse events were mild and transient. No serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: ANG003 lipase significantly improves DHA+EPA and total fat absorption in a dose dependent manner. Results for ANG003 protease and amylase activity suggest that doses lower than those in current porcine-derived PERTs may be efficacious.

AB  - The orthopoxvirus genus, particularly the monkeypox virus (MPXV), continues to pose a significant global public health threat. Therefore, the development of novel anti-orthopoxvirus agents remains an urgent priority. Machine learning has proven to be an effective approach for identifying potential drug candidates. In this study, we implemented a dual-view deep learning model that combines BERT and a graph neural network to analyze molecular sequences and structural graphs. The model was trained following a pre-training-then-fine-tuning paradigm and was subsequently applied to identify new molecules with potential anti-orthopoxvirus activity. Notably, a cinnamoyl anthranilic acid derivative (compound 6) was successfully predicted and demonstrated potent anti-orthopoxvirus effects both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, integrin subunit beta 3 (ITGB3) has been validated as one of the direct target protein of 6. In conclusion, we established a robust dual-view deep learning model for the discovery of novel anti-orthopoxvirus agents, and compound 6 is a promising candidate for orthopoxvirus treatment via ITGB3 targeting.

AB  - Drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains a major challenge to effective tuberculosis (TB) control. Cytochrome bd oxidase (Cyt-bd), a critical terminal oxidase within the electron transport chain of M. tuberculosis, maintains bacterial survival under respiratory stress but remains an underexplored therapeutic target. Here, we developed an integrated computational and experimental workflow to identify novel Cyt-bd inhibitors. Among the candidates, TB25, TB25-2, and TB25-14 exhibited substantial antimycobacterial efficacy, each reducing intracellular M. tuberculosis survival in macrophages by over 94 %. Importantly, co-treatment with Q203, a cytochrome bcc oxidase (Cyt-bcc) inhibitor, resulted in pronounced synergistic bactericidal effects. These findings highlight the potential of dual Cyt-bd/Cyt-bcc inhibition as a new strategy for treating drug-resistant and latent TB, and validate the effectiveness of our virtual screening pipeline for discovering new anti-TB agents.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Levofloxacin (LFX) has gained attention as an effective drug to reduce treatment duration in tuberculosis (TB). We aimed to evaluate factors related to interindividual variability (IIV) and describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LFX in both DS- and DR-TB, as well as explore the optimal dose for TB treatment. METHODS: We included demographics, clinical information, and LFX concentrations from multinational hospitals. All data were utilized for model establishment. The population PK model was built using nonlinear mixed-effects method. Dose simulation was carried out thereafter using Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: A one-compartment model with allometric scaling described LFX PK adequately. PK parameters were similar between DS- and DR-TB. eGFR significantly affected CL/F, which decreased by 22 % and 48 % in mild and moderate-severe renal impairment, respectively (normal CL/F: 6.6 L/h). Considering LFX's AUC/MIC target of 146 and epidemiological cut-off value of MIC 0.5 μg/mL, doses of 1000 mg, 1250 mg, and 1500 mg may achieve 90 % probability of target attainment in patients with normal renal function weighing <40 kg, 40-70 kg, and >70 kg, respectively. CONCLUSION: Renal impairment reduced LFX clearance. Doses equal to or greater than 1000 mg may improve AUC/MIC target attainment but require cautious use considering safety and clinical efficacy.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health challenge, underscoring the urgent need for new therapeutic options. In this study, a series of salicylidenehydrazine derivatives were synthesized and characterized using spectroscopic techniques. Their antimycobacterial activity was assessed against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. Among the 35 synthesized compounds, nine demonstrated significant inhibitory activity, with MIC values ranging from 0.78 to 50 μM. These active molecules were further evaluated against clinical isoniazid-resistant (bearing inhA promoter and/or katG mutations) and multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis strains. A particularly potent compound derived from 2-bromo-4-nitrosalicylaldehyde exhibited an MIC of 0.78 μM against H37Rv and demonstrated low MIC values of 6.25, 1.56, and 1.56 μM against the inhA + , katG + , and MDR strains, respectively. Molecular docking studies were also conducted to investigate the interaction of active compounds with the target enzyme InhA. Overall, the results indicate that salicylidenehydrazine derivatives represent promising lead structures for the development of new anti-TB agents effective against both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains.

AB  - A novel series of compounds was designed and synthesized by combining the distal piperazine nitrogen of the antifungal ketoconazole (KTZ) with primary arylsulfonamides. The aim of this study is to present the basis for a new generation of Malassezia antifungal agents able to inhibit the enzyme lanosterol-14α-demethylase (CYP51; EC 1.14.13.70) as well as a newly emergent therapeutic target: carbonic anhydrases (CAs; EC 4.2.1.1). The final compounds showed effective interactions with the intended targets in vitro, as well as KTZ comparable minimum inhibitory concentrations on yeast strains of the Malassezia genus: Malassezia furfur ATCC 14521; Malassezia globosa ATCC MYA 4612; and Malassezia pachydermatis DSM 6172. Overall, the data obtained account for the reported compounds as promising antifungal candidates with high safety profiles for the management of fungal infections.

AB  - In this study, a passively membrane-permeable short peptide inhibitor targeting the measles virus fusion protein (MeV-F) is reported. Measles virus (MeV) is highly contagious, yet no approved antiviral drugs are currently available. MeV-F plays a crucial role in viral infection, making it an attractive target for drug development. The fusion inhibitor peptide (FIP) is a well-known short peptide that binds to MeV-F and prevents its structural rearrangement. However, improving both inhibitory activity and passive membrane permeability is essential for developing orally available MeV-F inhibitors. Herein, FIP derivatives are explored through hydrogen-to-fluorine substitution and a derivative with enhanced inhibitory activity (IC

AB  - Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are widely used to assess microbial contamination in surface water. However, traditional FIB such as fecal coliforms and enterococcus often fail to reflect pathogen-related health risks due to differences in environmental persistence and behavior. This study evaluated Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) as an alternative FIB through a national-scale survey of 116 sites across seven major Chinese river basins impacted by anthropogenic contamination. C. perfringens was detected at all sites, with a median concentration of 700 CFU/100 mL, substantially higher than fecal coliforms (26 CFU/100 mL) and enterococcus (4 CFU/100 mL). It showed stronger correlations with priority bacterial pathogens (Shigella, Salmonella, Vibrio cholerae) and with microbial source tracking markers of human and livestock origin. A significant wastewater treatment plant downstream decay trend (k = -0.21, p < 0.05), aligned with key bacterial pathogens, further supports its diagnostic potential. Using reverse quantitative microbial risk assessment, generalized additive models, and species sensitivity distribution analysis, we derived a health-based guideline of 174 CFU/100 mL for C. perfringens, corresponding to the WHO benchmark of bacterial pathogens (10

AB  - A series of tetra-substituted tetrahydropyrimidines (TTHPs 501-528) was designed and synthesized by an efficient one-pot four-component reaction (4CR) to study their bioactivities as novel inhibitors against influenza A virus (H1N1) infection. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) indicates that the antiviral activities of TTHPs mainly depend on the combination of substituents, and three TTHPs (512, 513, and 521) show potent antiviral activities, with IC₅₀ values equal to 1.46, 5.09 and 4.06 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the mechanism of TTHP 512 against influenza virus A was investigated through western blotting, qRT-PCR, and an immunofluorescence assay. The primary mechanism study indicates that the most potent TTHP 512 exerts antiviral activity by affecting virus replication. In addition, TTHP 521 shows strong aggregation-induced emission and can target endoplasmic reticulum imaging.

AB  - Studies on ligand-enzyme binding modes on functional microorganism ureases are currently unexplored mainly due to the difficulties in obtaining purified native or recombinant microbial ureases. The investigation of interactions with small ligands, kinetic parameters and most of inhibitor screening is usually performed using the commercially available plant urease model. Herein, the unique urease paramagnetic Ni(II) bimetallic center and saturation transfer from protein to ligand protons were explored by NMR to access the ligand-urease binding profile in Cryptococcus neoformans cell lysates. Thiohydantoins derived from L-valine (1a), D-valine (1b) and L-methionine (3) presented high inhibitory percentages on the ureolytic activity of the fungal lysates, ranging from 84.0 % to 86.3 %. Evaluation of the relaxation rate of the water protons by NMR during titration with inhibitor 1a, revealed the binding of the ligand to the Ni(II) catalytic site of the fungal urease in the lysates. The enhanced relaxation rate of the water protons resonance, induced by their contact with the paramagnetic urease site, decreased linearly from 0.7 s

AB  - Disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), such as functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), affect about one-third of the global population. Many patients turn to traditional and herbal medicines for relief, given the lack of effective therapies. This review assesses the clinical and preclinical evidence for herbal treatments used for patients with DGBI. Placebo-controlled trials show that specific herbal preparations, including peppermint oil, ginger, and commercial formulations like STW-5, ZZKZ and Rikkunshito significantly improve gastrointestinal symptoms. Their effectiveness likely arises from various mechanisms, such as alterations in gastrointestinal motility, desensitization of visceral sensory function, and suppression of low-grade mucosal or systemic inflammation. Recent studies of the effects of herbal extracts on the gastrointestinal microbiome also implicate microbial involvement in their effectiveness. Most herbal preparations contain multiple bioactive compounds to address various disease mechanisms, and there remains a significant gap in dose-response studies for optimizing therapeutic outcomes.

AB  - The discovery of bioactive compounds is a complex endeavor that frequently involves investigation of natural products (NPs). However, inherent difficulties associated with the extraction and synthesis of NPs have prompted the development of alternative methods. In this context, pseudo-natural products (pNPs) - synthetic compounds that resemble the structural intricacy of NPs - emerge as a useful source of bioactive chemical entities. The simplicity of the design principles for pNPs allows for a vast diversity of libraries to be envisioned, which is limited only by creativity and the synthetic tools available for generating them. In this study, we employed a combination of fragment- and reaction-based de novo designs to create pNPs that mimic the structural complexity of NPs while exploring uncharted chemical spaces. The library of pNPs synthesized via multicomponent reactions was subjected to phenotypic biological assays to evaluate their bioactivity. Among the tested compounds, two exhibited significant antiviral properties. Notably, one of these compounds demonstrated potent activity against both Zika virus (ZIKV) and SARS-CoV2, highlighting its potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent. Further investigation revealed that the antiviral activity of this compound might be associated with modulation of host cell lipid droplets, a novel mechanism of action that warrants further exploration.

AB  - Given the widespread environmental presence of thioxanthones (TXs), a class of commonly used photoinitiators, great concerns have been raised regarding their potential human exposure and associated health risks. However, a comprehensive understanding of the total burden of human exposure to these compounds remains limited. To address this gap, the current study collected urine samples from 211 healthy adults in Taizhou City, China, and, for the first time, analyzed the presence of TXs and their metabolites in human urine. The findings revealed that 2-ITX (2-isopropylthioxanthone) and DETX (2,4-diethylthioxanthone) were more frequently detected than other TXs, displaying the detection frequencies of 82% and 79%, respectively, in human urine. Measured mean levels of 2-ITX and DETX were 0.66 ng/mL and 0.51 ng/mL, respectively, in human urine. Female participants (0.67 ± 0.24 ng/mL) demonstrated higher (

AB  - The emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) greatly threatens human health. Here, a series of TPP-HK conjugates with potent bacterial cytoplasmic membrane-targeting capabilities were developed to combat the escalating threat of MRSA infections. Among them, TH16 showed excellent antibacterial activity and low frequency resistance. Mechanistic studies revealed that TH16 destroyed the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and increased the levels of intracellular ROS, resulting in bacterial death. Our study demonstrates that TPP-HK conjugates as membrane-targeting agents could be a promising therapeutic strategy against MRSA infections.

AB  - Small-molecule screens can advance therapeutic discovery and uncover new features of pathogen biology. Through a luminescence-based screen, we identified clinically approved dihydropyridines that impaired fitness of the intracellular pathogen Brucella ovis in mammalian phagocytes. Given that dihydropyridines block mammalian L-type calcium channels, and based on our observation that drug treatment perturbed calcium and manganese levels in host phagocytes, we initially hypothesized a host-directed mechanism of action. However, dose-response assays in axenic medium showed that dihydropyridines have direct antimicrobial effects. To explore the genetic basis of dihydropyridine sensitivity, we selected for B. ovis mutants capable of growing in the presence of cilnidipine, a representative compound from this drug class. Cilnidipine-resistant mutants harbored single-nucleotide deletions in the bepE transporter pseudogene that restored its open reading frame, enabling expression of a functional RND-family transporter. B. ovis is a host-restricted ovine pathogen that has experienced significant pseudogenization in its recent evolutionary history. Reversion mutations that restored the open reading frame of the bepE pseudogene increased B. ovis resistance not only to dihydropyridines but also to a broad range of cell envelope-disrupting agents. Conversely, deleting bepE in Brucella abortus, a closely related zoonotic species that retains an intact version of the gene, increased its sensitivity to envelope disruptors in vitro and to cilnidipine in the intracellular niche. We conclude that bepE is a key determinant of chemical stress resistance in Brucella spp., and that its pseudogenization in B. ovis contributes to the documented hypersensitivity of this host-restricted lineage to chemical stressors.

AB  - Whole-cell biosensors (WCBs) are instrumental platforms for discovering and characterizing regulatory elements and advancing bioengineering. They also hold immense promise for environmental and food monitoring. While significant efforts have been invested in enhancing their sensitivity and portability, the standardization of their handling and data analysis remains relatively underdeveloped. This article presents a comprehensive guide to utilizing two recently developed WCBs, Mer-Blue and Mer-RFP, proven capable of detecting ionic mercury at levels below the World Health Organization's drinking water limits. The protocols detailed herein encompass microbial culture preparation, sensor calibration, data acquisition, and analysis. For the fluorometric Mer-RFP biosensor, a novel biosynthesis allocation theorem is employed to identify the time interval for reliable and accurate dose-response measurements. For the colorimetric Mer-Blue biosensor, a low-cost camera setup enables rigorous measurements in settings lacking expensive spectrophotometers and fluorimeters, facilitating decentralized pollution monitoring. The procedures used for testing freshwater samples are described, and the limitations of these biosensors with respect to sample types are discussed. By sharing these handling and analysis techniques, we encourage broader research groups to adopt and improve these biological devices for developing effective environmental monitoring solutions. Ultimately, this research aims to facilitate the widespread adoption of biosensor technologies within the environmental science community, contributing to more effective and efficient monitoring of trace element pollution in various ecosystems.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Capsaicin (CAP), the pungent component of chili peppers, possesses diverse bioactive properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial effects. However, its impact on gastrointestinal integrity and microbial ecology remains dose-dependent and incompletely understood. This study aimed to investigate the effects of varying CAP doses on intestinal morphology, tight junction protein expression, goblet cell density, mucosal injury markers, and gut microbiota composition in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-five male Kunming mice were randomly assigned to five groups (n = 15/group): Normal control, vehicle control (dimethyl sulfoxide), low-dose CAP (5 mg/kg), medium-dose (15 mg/kg), and high-dose (20 mg/kg). Mice received oral gavage every other day for 14 days. Histological assessments (H&E and Alcian Blue-Periodic Acid-Schiff staining), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for diamine oxidase, fatty acid-binding protein 2, and plasma endotoxin as well as immunohistochemistry for ZO-1, Claudin-1, and Occludin, and 16S rRNA sequencing were employed to evaluate structural and microbial changes. RESULTS: Low-dose CAP significantly enhanced villus height, reduced crypt depth, and elevated the villus-to-crypt ratio across all intestinal segments (p < 0.05). Tight junction protein expression and goblet cell counts were highest in the low-dose group, suggesting mucosal protection. In contrast, medium and high-dose CAP induced epithelial damage, villus atrophy, and downregulation of junctional proteins. Microbiota analysis revealed the suppression of Proteobacteria and the expansion of Firmicutes in the medium- and high-dose groups. All CAP doses stimulated microbial biosynthesis of cofactors, vitamins, and electron carriers, with enhanced alpha diversity at higher doses. CONCLUSION: CAP exhibits a biphasic effect on intestinal physiology. While low-dose administration supports mucosal integrity and promotes beneficial microbial functions, higher doses disrupt epithelial architecture and induce dysbiosis. These findings underscore the importance of dose consideration in CAP's dietary and therapeutic applications, providing mechanistic insights into its gut-mediated effects.

AB  - Invasive fungal infections caused by Candida albicans are associated with high morbidity and mortality, highlighting the urgent need for novel antifungal agents. Compound 2 m in combination with fluconazole exhibited a significant synergistic effect (fractional inhibitory concentration index range: 0.15-0.17) and demonstrated enhanced efficacy against fluconazole-resistant strains. The combination therapy inhibited hyphal growth and biofilm formation, promoted the exposure of cell wall components, and disrupted cell membrane integrity. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed damage to cellular structures. The mechanism of action may be related to the downregulation of cell wall synthesis related genes (WSC1, WSC2, and FKS1) to inhibit C. albicans activity. This combination therapy reduced the renal fungal burden and inflammation in vivo, improved survival, and restored immune function. Additionally, compound 2 m demonstrated low cytotoxicity, suggesting its potential as an antimicrobial enhancer for fluconazole, and augmenting its inhibitory effect against fungal strains through synergistic effects, thereby offering a novel strategic approach for antifungal therapy.

To this end, new TZAA analogs bearing chemical modifications in the side chain and/or C8-methyl group moieties were synthesized. These analogs are not accessible from natural TZAA and therefore required total synthesis. As a result, four of the newly synthesized TZAA analogs exhibited more potent and selective inhibitory activity against R. oryzae compared to TZAA.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant threat to the global health sector. Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) were synthesized with aqueous crude extract of Azadirachta indica, and the phytochemical compositions determined using Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). They were further characterized using advanced spectroscopes and microscopes. The results showed arrays of ZnO NPs nanorods with maximal absorption wavelengths of 320 nm. The GC-MS revealed the presence of twenty volatile phytochemicals associated with the synthesized ZnO NPs. Among the volatile compounds, in silico study revealed Scoparone as the most bioactive compound. The ZnO NPs were separately functionalized with Scoparone-rich portion of the extract (ZnO NPs-S), and Ampicillin (ZnO NPs-amp). Subsequently, the nanoparticles were assessed for their antioxidants, and in vitro antimicrobial properties on antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli. In vitro study assessed the colony counts (cfu) of the E. coli in the presence of the antimicrobials; dehydrogenase inhibitory properties of ZnO NPs-S, ZnONPs-amp, extract of A. indica, and Ampicillin (standard drug). At the concentration of 500 μm/mL, 57.89 % and 89.74 % of the enzyme activities were inhibited by ZnO NPs-S, and ZnONPs-amp respectively.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biogenic synthesis of zinc nanoparticles (ZnNPs) has attracted significant interest due to their unique properties and potential biological applications. Unlike chemical and physical methods, biogenic synthesis offers a greener and more eco-friendly alternative. This study explores the synthesis of zinc-based nanoparticles using two distinct bacterial strains. RESULTS: In this study, zinc nanoparticles were synthesized in two forms: single-phase zinc sulfide nanoparticles (ZnS NPs) and mixed-phase zinc sulfide-oxide nanoparticles (ZnS-ZnO NPs), using Achromobacter sp. S4 and Pseudomonas sp. S6. The synthesis conditions were optimized for each strain, with pH playing a crucial role: Achromobacter sp. S4 favored basic conditions (pH 8.0) for zinc nanoparticles production, while Pseudomonas sp. S6 preferred acidic conditions (pH 4.7). TEM analysis revealed that Zn NPs from Pseudomonas sp. S6 were rod-shaped, whereas those from Achromobacter sp. S4 were spherical. Further characterization using EDX, XRD, and FTIR confirmed the successful synthesis of single phase ZnS NPs and hybride phase ZnS-ZnO NPs. Antimicrobial dose-response testing showed that single-phase ZnS NPs inhibited Klebsiella pneumoniae, while mixed-phase ZnS-ZnO NPs were effective against Staphylococcus epidermidis at 100 µg/ml based on inhibition zone measurements.Furthermore, the mixed-phase ZnS-ZnO NPs at 25 µg/ml demonstrated superior inhibition of microbial growth in sludge samples, likely due to a synergistic effect. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates the successful biogenic synthesis of ZnS NPs, and ZnS-ZnO NPs using two bacterial strains, with distinct morphological and functional properties. The use of two bacterial species was to assess strain-specific differences in nanoparticle synthesis and performance. The synthesized nanoparticles exhibited promising antimicrobial and environmental remediation potential, highlighting their applicability in both biomedical and environmental fields.

AB  - This study proposes a machine learning-based peptide screening strategy for identifying wheat-derived peptides with anti-caries potential. By integrating multiple feature descriptors and algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost), we constructed a Screening Funnel Model and identified a wheat-derived peptide AP-2 (FPVTWRWWKWW) as the prioritized candidate. Experimental validation demonstrated that AP-2 exhibits potent antibacterial activity against Streptococcus mutans (MIC = 4 μM), achieving rapid bactericidal effects through bacterial membrane disruption, and significantly inhibits biofilm formation at 1/2 × MIC concentration. AP-2 exhibited an extremely low hemolysis rate and demonstrated favorable stability in saliva within 1 h. In vivo, studies confirmed that AP-2 effectively prevents early caries formation in rats at low concentrations without inducing organ toxicity or oral microbiota dysbiosis. These results demonstrate the utility of machine learning in discovering wheat-derived anti-caries peptides and indicate that AP-2 represents a safe and effective candidate for clinical translation.

AB  - Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), a major anthropogenic stressor, can threaten soil health by disrupting vital microbial processes critical to maintaining key soil functions such as nutrient cycling, organic matter decomposition, and soil structure formation. Their safe use demands proactive strategies to preserve soils, a globally essential and non-renewable resource that acts as the ultimate sink for nanoparticles released into ecosystems. As functionally critical components of soil ecosystems, microorganisms warrant central consideration in developing nanotoxicity mitigation strategies. This review establishes a framework for soil health protection through systematic examination of (a) AgNPs-mediated ecotoxicological impacts on soil ecosystems, (b) microbial community tolerance thresholds, and (c) ecosystem functions most vulnerable to AgNPs exposure. Through bibliometric analysis of 61 studies, we synthesized comprehensive data on AgNPs-tolerant/sensitive microbial taxa and functional genes, while highlighting critical research gaps and priority research area. Our assessment identifies the following key challenges in predicting AgNPs ecotoxicity in soil systems: (1) a wide toxicity dose-response range, with significant effects observed even at environmentally relevant concentrations (≤1.0 mg/kg), (2) high microbial taxonomic heterogeneity complicating targeted identification, as most taxa remain unculturable, uncharacterized, or classifiable only at higher taxonomic ranks, and (3) limited knowledge of soil-AgNPs-environment interactions hindering identification of critical factors controlling AgNPs toxicity in soils. We then demonstrate how functional gene analysis can improve toxicity prediction accuracy and identify compromised soil processes. This functional genomics approach outperforms taxonomic characterization in predicting AgNPs impacts on soil health by directly quantifying disturbances to critical ecosystem processes. This framework will guide future research in predicting AgNPs' impacts on soil microbial functionality and overall soil health, while offering a broadly applicable approach to assess toxicity for other emerging anthropogenic stressors, including engineered nanomaterials, pesticides, microplastics, and other soil contaminants.

AB  - Despite longstanding oyster cooking recommendations, outbreaks associated with cooked oysters still occur. A survey of U.S.-based restaurants was conducted to investigate common cooking practices, including steaming, baking, and roasting. Target restaurants were identified using Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes and surveyed through live phone interviews and online. The questionnaire included open- and closed-ended questions for restaurant staff, including chefs and managers, with topics covering customer and serving quantities, source of purchase, common cooking methods, cooking time and temperature combinations, and the use of thermometers. A total of 105 complete responses were collected from California, Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Oregon, Virginia, and Washington. On a weekly basis, the majority of restaurants served 1-1,000 customers with 1-500 dozen oysters. The most frequently used cooking methods were frying (46%), followed by baking (36%), steaming (30%), and then roasting (23%). On average, baking was performed at a temperature of 185 ± 64°C for 9 ± 4 minutes, roasting at 207 ± 54°C for 8 ± 6 minutes, and steaming for 5 ± 3 minutes, with no correlation being found between cooking time and temperature for either technique. Additionally, 57% of the surveyed restaurants did not use thermometers when cooking oysters. This study highlights the variations in oyster cooking practices in U.S. restaurants, emphasizing the need to assess the effectiveness of different cooking techniques through quantitative microbial risk assessment of the most common pathogens in oysters. This will help improve food safety guidelines and minimize health risks associated with the consumption of partially cooked oysters.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Airborne fungal spores are recognized for their human health impact, yet dose-response relationships remain undefined despite decades of bioaerosol sampling and analysis. In this article, we quantify immunologically active compounds, using six fungal-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and compare them with cultivation, spore counting, and quantitative PCR (qPCR), using identical filter extract aliquots, various concentrations, single-organism aerosols, and mixes, in a controlled environment. Results showed high agreement between ELISAs and spore counting. By contrast, CFU enumeration and qPCR showed lower correlation with the other methods. Results of ELISAs showed high reproducibility of technical replicates and sampling duplicates, whereas CFU and qPCR results had high deviations. ELISA detection limits ranged from 10 to 100 spores/mL for larger spores ( IMPORTANCE: Bioaerosol detection and analysis is an ongoing field of research. Although various methodologies are used for collection and analysis, there is no single method available to close the knowledge gap between exposure and health impact. For airborne fungal material, the standard analysis method remains cultivation. With molecular technology advancing in the field, both methods can only show the exposure to living, cultivatable, or total fungal cells in the airborne environment. To close the gap between airborne concentrations and impact on the human body, recognition of the allergenic potential is necessary. Therefore, we evaluated six fungal-specific ELISAs to make them ready for application in field studies and compared them to cultivation, spore counting, and molecular genetic methods. We are confident that in the future antigen-recognizing methods like the tested ELISAs will enable moving from particle detection toward detection of the disease-causing agent.

AB  - School health staff need decision support for responding to respiratory viral outbreaks. Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) tools are an inexpensive and fast resource. Our objectives were to engage school districts to inform the development of a risk-based calculator tool, test the tool across hypothetical cases, and elicit feedback among school health staff. We administered an online survey for Kindergarten (K) - Grade 5 teachers, school health professionals, and other school staff to gather data about respiratory viral disease interventions and model parameters. A risk calculator tool was developed in which users choose hypothetical scenarios to estimate infection risk per individual and compare interventions. Three case studies (CS) were explored: CS1 - Rhinovirus transmission in a general education classroom with "poor" vs. "great" air quality, CS2 - Influenza A virus transmission in a music classroom with vs. without a portable air purifier, CS3 - SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a special education classroom with vs. without open doors/windows. The prototype tool was presented at a national school nursing meeting, and attendees were surveyed on (dis)likes and anticipated tool uses. For the initial survey of Arizona school personnel (n = 132), the top respiratory viral outbreak strategies reported by teachers were hand (94 %) and surface hygiene (85.1 %). For all case studies, infection risks were above thresholds used in other contexts but were comparable to published student respiratory illness incidence data. At the national meeting, school nurses (n = 12) identified potential uses including advocating for interventions to administrators. This work reflects a unique application of community partnership and QMRA to address school health decision support.

AB  - Eriodictyol and diosmetin are bioactive flavonoids. This study explored their antimicrobial activities and antibiofilm potential along with the effect on pyocyanin and protease production and virulence-linked gene expression, followed by in silico molecular target predictions. Moreover, keratinocytes were used for the evaluation of cytotoxicity and protective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in the infected cells. Both compounds have shown significant antibacterial capacity towards skin pathogens (minimal inhibitory concentrations 0.025-0.2 mg/mL). Their ability to prevent biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was drastic, as well as the impact on other virulence factors, proteases, and pyocyanin production. RT-qPCR determined downregulation of almost all genes examined (lasI, lasR, lasB, rhlI, rhlR, rhlC, pqsH, pqsR, pvdS, pvdF, phzM, and algK), while molecular docking predicted strong binding affinities to the LasI, LasR, PqsR, and QscR quorum-sensing proteins. Moreover, both compounds were not toxic to HaCaT and were able to reduce damage induced by P. aeruginosa in this cell line. Precisely, eriodictyol reduced levels of secreted IL-6 (from 335.32 to 261.76 pg), while both compounds reduced the formation of superoxide. Both eriodictyol and diosmetin displayed remarkable antimicrobial potential while employing a wide array of antimicrobial mechanisms, making them attractive candidates for further assessment and eventual incorporation into novel therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Because of the numerous useful components they contain, plants are significant resources that are being explored for their varied purposes in industry, food, and medicine. Recently, particularly endemic species have gained attention with the identification of their different ingredients and characteristics and the exploration of their precious features. This research assessed the endemic species Astragalus elatus's bioactive components utilizing UHPLC-Orbitrap®-HRMS, its antibacterial qualities utilizing the disc diffusion method, its cytotoxic impact on cervical cancer utilizing the MTT method, and its apoptosis effect by annexin V methods. Additionally, Astragalus elatus's antidiabetic activity was revealed by in silico and in vitro examinations of its inhibitory effect on the enzymes α-Amylase and α-Glucosidase. Consequently, it was discovered that A. elatus can be utilized in the treatment of cervical cancer and has effective cytotoxic and apoptotic effects on HeLa cells. Additionally, it was detected that A. elatus possesses antibacterial and anti-diabetic properties. Compared to gram-negative bacteria, A. elatus had a greater inhibitory effect on gram-positive bacteria. The pharmacokinetically significant characteristics and their tendency for chemical reactions of this plant's primary phenolic compounds were identified by utilizing DFT, molecular docking, and ADME/T.

AB  - Two series of benzofuran-based thiosemicarbazides 7, 8(a-l) are evaluated as P. aeruginosa quorum sensing inhibitors (QSIs). The studied compounds resulted in reduction of violacein production of C. violaceum, at ¼ MIC, up to 26.04-67.36 %, relative to the reference drug azithromycin (54 %). In vitro evaluation of QS and antivirulence activities, at the same concentration, against P. aeruginosa, showed promising inhibitory effect of biofilms formation, bacterial motility and virulence factors production (pyocyanin, and rhamnolipids). Compounds 7a, 7d, and 7k inhibit biofilm formation up to 57.31 %, 67.54 %, 78.38 %, respectively, in addition to >50 % inhibition of hemolysin production. On the other hand, compounds 8a, 8d, 8f and 8k of the bromobenzofuran series showed, 55.66 %, 50.67 %, 73.34 %, 79.93 %, reduction in biofilm formation, respectively. Compounds 8d and 8f exhibit >50 % reduction of hemolysin and protease. In vivo study on mice groups infected with P. aeruginosa, previously treated with compounds 7k or 8f, revealed 50 % survival protection, accompanied by decrease in bacterial loads in kidney and liver tissues up to 50 % relative to the untreated group.

AB  - Starter feeds in pre-ruminant diets help optimize ruminal development before weaning, contributing significantly to lifelong health and performance. This study investigated the effects of varying neutral detergent fiber (NDF) levels in starter diets on growth, serum indices, slaughter performance, nutrient digestibility, gastrointestinal tract (GIT) development, and microbial profiles of dairy goat kids. Sixty 14-d-old Xinong Saanen dairy goat kids were assigned to 3 groups (n = 20/group) with NDF levels of 20%, 25%, or 30%. All kids received milk and starters from day 15 to 84. Body weight (BW) was monitored bi-weekly, and blood was sampled at weeks 2, 6, 10, and 12. At 12 wk, 3 male kids per group were slaughtered for GIT morphology, enzyme activity, microbial profiles, and carcass assessment. The 25N and 30N groups exhibited significantly greater overall BW (P < 0.01) and serum aspartate transaminase (AST; P < 0.01) and β-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA; P < 0.01). Dressing percentage, duodenum mass, jejunum mass, and total small intestine mass increased linearly (P < 0.05) with higher NDF levels. The ruminal papilla length (P < 0.05) and papilla width (P < 0.05), the villus height/crypt depth (VH/CD) of jejunum (P < 0.01) and the mucosal thickness (P < 0.01) of ileum also increased linearly as dietary NDF levels increased. Enzyme activities, such as cellulase in the rumen (P = 0.071) and small intestine (P = 0.075) tended to increase with increasing NDF content, whereas α-amylase in the rumen (P < 0.05) and small intestine (P < 0.05), pepsin in the rumen (P < 0.01) and trypsin in the small intestine (P < 0.05) decreased. Increasing NDF levels resulted in linear responses (P < 0.05) in ruminal acetate, butyrate, acetate/propionate (A/P) ratio, and total volatile fatty acid concentrations. In the rumen, Lachnospiraceae_UCG-010 and norank_f_UCG-010_o__Oscillospirales, fibrolytic microorganisms were more abundant in the 30N group, while Succinivibrio, a saccharolytic bacterium was enriched in the 20N group. In the jejunum, norank_o__Clostridia_vadinBB60_group and unclassified_f__Lachnospiraceae, were enriched in the 25N and 30N groups. In contrast, Candidatus_Arthromitus, Mitsuokella, and norank_f__F082, involved in host immunity, were significantly enriched in the 20N group. Overall, starters containing 25% and 30% NDF promoted fiber-degrading bacteria and enhanced GIT development, thereby optimizing the growth performance of dairy goat kids.

AB  - This study introduces a farm-to-fork quantitative risk assessment (QRA) model for invasive listeriosis from ready-to-eat diced cantaloupe. The modular model comprises seven stages-preharvest (soil and irrigation contamination), harvest (cross-contamination and survival), pre-processing (brushing), processing (flume tank washing, dicing and equipment cross-contamination), lot testing, cold-chain transport and retail growth, and consumer storage/handling. Each stage employs stochastic functions to simulate microbial prevalence and concentration changes (growth, inactivation, removal, partitioning, cross-contamination) using published data. In a reference scenario-good agricultural practices (soil barriers, no preharvest irrigation), hygienic processing and proper cold storage-the model predicts low lot- and pack-level contamination, with few packs >10 CFU/g and most servings below detection; the mean risk per serving is very low. "What-if" analyses highlight critical control points: the absence of soil barriers with preharvest irrigation can increase the risk by 10,000-fold; flume tank water contamination has a greater impact than harvest-stage cross-contamination; and poor consumer storage can raise the risk by up to 500-fold. This flexible QRA framework enables regulators and industry to evaluate and optimize interventions-from improved agricultural measures to targeted sampling plans and consumer guidance-to mitigate listeriosis risk from RTE diced cantaloupe.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to explore the probable effectiveness of personal protective equipment (PPE) and environmental controls in protecting healthcare workers from Covid-19 infection using the Covid Exposure Model and Risk App (CEMRA), which estimates the risk of infection by various pathways. METHODS: We adapted a compartmental model of nine states within a hospital room to estimate virus transport and fate for contact and inhalation transmission from an infected patient, implemented using a discrete-time Markov-chain. Cough spray transmission was modeled separately, extrapolated to the expiratory volume, with a probability of the cough impacting the face in proportion to the surface area of the mucous membranes. Infectious profiles of patients observed in hospitals, constructed using information on salivary virus concentration, exhaled emissions and cough frequency, were categorized from "extremely low" to "extremely high" in seven steps. We parameterized the model using measurements made in three Scottish hospitals along with estimates from the literature. Seven interventions spanning PPE, engineering controls and administrative controls were applied to simulations of a health care worker working in a small room. RESULTS: Route of infection and to a lesser extent efficacy of controls depended on the infectiousness of the patient; inhalation was the main transmission route in scenarios from "extremely low" to "moderate" infectiousness. For these lower infectious profiles, the surgical mask, surgical mask combined with hand hygiene, and surgical mask, hand hygiene and surface disinfection showed between a 60% and 64% average reduction in risk compared with no intervention. The use of natural ventilation and an air purification device resulted in a modeled 71% to 77% reduction in risk. A healthcare worker wearing an FFP2 or FFP3 respirator, was associated with an 86% to 95% reduction in risk. Finally, a ventilated headboard or a powered respirator with hood showed between a 91% and 99% reduction in risk. For the "high" to "extremely high" infectious profiles the cough spray route predominated, although the modeled effectiveness of the interventions was similar to the lower infectious profiles. CONCLUSION: The use of a flexible quantitative microbial risk assessment model can assess the likely reduction of risk of Covid-19 from workplace controls under various assumptions. Respirators and local ventilation were the most effective modeled interventions.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe mental disorder that occurs after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. Not only does this disorder severely impair the quality of life and emotional wellbeing of patients, but in recent years the global rate of PTSD diagnoses has increased to 1.5-2 times, and the prevalence of PTSD associated with COVID-19 events in particular has surged to 10%-25%, underscoring the urgency of developing effective treatments. The lifetime prevalence of PTSD in the general population is estimated to be approximately 3.9%, while in high-risk populations, such as war veterans, it can be as high as 30%. As a key pathway connecting the central nervous system to peripheral organs, the gut-brain axis has received increasing attention for its role in PTSD. Although the gut-brain axis has been shown to be associated with several psychiatric disorders, especially depression, its specific role in PTSD remains undercharacterized. Existing studies suggest that specific strains of

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) approach was used to determine the dosage regimens of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections after intravenous (IV) and per os (PO) administration in horses. METHODS: Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole plasma concentrations were measured in six horses after a single IV administration of 15 mg/kg (2.5 mg/kg trimethoprim and 12.5 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole) and PO administration of 30 mg/kg (5.0 mg/kg trimethoprim and 25.0 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole). The data were modeled using a nonlinear mixed-effects model. The probability of target attainment (PTA) of the PK/PD target defined as the ratio of the area under the free plasma concentration-time curve to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) over 25 h was calculated for 5000 horses using Monte Carlo simulations. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole dosage regimens of 15 mg/kg IV and 30 mg/kg PO at the approved interval of q12h did not attain therapeutic targets for MRSA infections in horses. More frequent administration (q8h) may be necessary to achieve these targets. In addition, this standard dosage achieved only 90 % PTA against the MIC of 0.125/2.38 mg/L and did not achieve against the MIC for the CLSI breakpoint for humans (2.0/38 mg/L).

AB  - A new series of thiourea derivatives bearing uracil ring was synthesized. The reaction of 5-amino uracil with isothiocyanate derivatives afforded the corresponding thiourea-uracil derivatives in excellent yields. The antimicrobial activity of the synthesized thiourea-uracil derivatives was successfully determined against different pathogen types. Interestingly, some derivatives such as TUU-05 and TUU-08 show a potent impact on microbial proliferation with a notable MIC value, particularly in the case of Aspergillus niger (7.5 ± 2.11 μg/mL). Accordingly, compound TUU-08 was considered a promising antimicrobial agent that could release elevated Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and inhibit the bacterial Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR) enzyme at lower IC

AB  - Species within the Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), a subset of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), are of major human health concern and contribute to a significant drinking water burden in the United States (US) and worldwide. The risk increases when MAC levels in environmental media are high, the hosts are susceptible, and exposures to aerosols containing MAC are frequent. MAC is typically not monitored in drinking water; currently, there are no numeric guidelines for NTM or MAC concentrations in distribution networks or building plumbing systems. To address this gap, the primary objective of this study was to identify risk-based critical MAC concentrations for identifying problematic conditions in building water. Critical concentrations were based on an annual risk benchmark of 1 in 10,000 commonly referenced in the US for drinking water-related infections using quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA). Critical concentrations of MAC were calculated for eight potential scenarios including inhalation and ingestion exposures for children, immune-compromised individuals, and the general population.

AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases pose significant public health challenges, necessitating innovative and sustainable control measures. This study evaluates the larvicidal potential of six extremophile Bacillus species against Aedes aegypti larvae, focusing on dose-response relationships, resistance trends, and genetic diversity. Regression analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between concentration and larval mortality across species, with B. sonorensis and B. paramycoides demonstrating superior potency at lower concentrations (LC₅₀: 19.72 ppm and 23.41 ppm, respectively). Probit analysis confirmed that B. sonorensis is the most effective larvicide, achieving high mortality rates with minimal concentrations. In contrast, B. licheniformis and B. stercoris exhibited limited efficacy, requiring significantly higher doses to achieve comparable results. Resistance analysis highlighted an inverse relationship between toxicity index and resistance ratio, with B. sonorensis maintaining high efficacy even in resistant mosquito populations (Resistance Ratio: 1). Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed distinct evolutionary relationships among species, with B. rugosus and B. tequilensis clustering closely, suggesting functional similarities. The genetic divergence of B. licheniformis aligns with its lower larvicidal performance. Overall, this study underscores the potential of B. sonorensis and B. paramycoides as robust candidates for mosquito control programs, particularly in resistance-prone environments. The findings provide valuable insights into optimizing microbial larvicides by tailoring species-specific application strategies and leveraging genetic diversity within the Bacillus genus.

AB  - The identification of novel anti-tubercular agents that inhibit the function of less-explored yet essential components of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is critically needed to address the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis. The type II NADH dehydrogenase, an indispensable component of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, is the entry point of electrons into the electron transport chain, facilitating ATP production. This enzyme is a promising drug target because its inhibition leads to a bactericidal response through energy starvation. In our study, we synthesized a series of 6-isopropyl benzothiazole derivatives, with various thioacetamide side chains; and assessed their anti-tubercular efficacy, and specificity toward NADH dehydrogenase through in vitro studies. The most potent compounds, C4-1 (MIC = 4 μg/mL, 13.042 μM), and C4-11 (MIC = 8 μg/mL, 24.80 μM), exhibited inhibitory effects against mycobacterial strains, exhibiting resistance to FDA approved anti-tubercular drugs; and demonstrated bactericidal activity with a safety index exceeding 10. The primary target for these derivatives is proposed to be type II NADH dehydrogenase, indicated by increased NADH/NAD

AB  - Floods are the most common type of natural disaster worldwide and have substantial socioeconomic and environmental impacts, including public health effects. Exposure to floodwaters containing pathogens poses risks to infectious diseases such as cholera, leading to diminished well-being and even loss of life. Accra, the capital of Ghana, has a long history of flood events and cholera outbreaks. Post-flood periods have the potential for transmission of water-borne diseases with significantly higher cholera risk. This study aims to assess the health risks associated with Vibrio cholerae pathogens after flood events and evaluate their impacts on Accra's population, focusing on Alajo, a neighbourhood in Accra. A post-flood pathogen (SPATE) model was developed, integrating hydrological processes (evaporation and infiltration) and pathogen decay rate, to simulate the spatial temporal distribution of floodwater ponds and the V. cholerae concentrations therein. The infection probability was calculated with the quantitative microbial and flood risk assessment. After flooding, the risk of V. cholerae infection tends to be higher in scattered ponds near the drainage network, surrounding areas of the Onyasia river, and the urban area northeastern of Alajo. The peak risk of V. cholerae infection occurs within the first 12 h post-flooding, declining rapidly thereafter. Variations in infection probability and flood exceedance probability are observed across the area, with an overall trend of reduced infection probability with increasing return periods. Notably, children engaging in water activities face higher risks compared to adults wading in post-flood waters. These findings contribute to decision-making in flood risk management and health risk assessment, facilitating prioritization of vulnerable areas and resource allocation to mitigate and prevent the health impacts of flooding, considering explicitly for the time after flooding when the risk remains elevated.

AB  - The traditional Chinese medicine Euphorbia fischeriana Steud (E. fischeriana) has been used for treating lymph node tuberculosis (TB) for a long time. This study demonstrates that Jolkinolide B, a component of E. fischeriana, exhibits antimycobacterial activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 3 μg/mL against M. tuberculosis H37Ra. Additionally, it shows bactericidal effect on RAW264.7 macrophages infected with M. tuberculosis at a concentration of 2 × MIC. Mechanistic study via transcriptome revealed that Jolkinolide B significantly reduced the transcription of 17 ribosomal proteins, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis in M. tuberculosis. RT-qPCR confirmed that Jolkinolide B decreased the expression of mycobacterial ribosomal proteins in a concentration-dependent manner. Finally, morphological observations indicated that Jolkinolide B caused the tubercle bacilli to become shorter and deformed. This study highlights a natural compound from E. fischeriana and clarifies its mechanism of action against TB, supporting the rational use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and antibiotics in TB treatment.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are natural molecules of great interest in the fight against bacteria and in addressing antibiotic resistance. Their use as antimicrobial drugs is still limited due to their cytotoxicity and poor resistance to proteolysis. PMAP-36 and BMAP-27 are cathelicidins that contribute to innate immunity. Two short sequences, PMAP(12-24) and BMAP(1-18), are the most promising analogues identified but despite their broad antibacterial activity, they undergo rapid proteolytic degradation. In this study, the D and L enantiomers of the two peptides were synthesised, and their structures were elucidated and compared by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and 2D-NMR analysis. Conformational studies revealed that, despite their short sequence, all peptides adopted helical structures in membrane-mimetic environments, with subtle differences between the two AMP groups, PMAP(12-24) being more prone to adopt a mixed α/3

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance poses a critical threat to global health, necessitating the development of new therapeutics. Peptoids are synthetic analogs of peptides with an N-substituted glycine backbone and have been investigated for antimicrobial therapeutic applications due to their resistance to proteolysis and tunable structures. This study explores antimicrobial peptoids functionalized with polyamine side chains, leveraging the cationic nature of polyamines to enhance interactions with bacterial membranes. A structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis was conducted to elucidate the influence of polyamine chain length and density on antimicrobial potency and selectivity. The optimized peptoids demonstrated potent activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains, while maintaining low cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that these peptoids employ multiple killing mechanisms, including membrane disruption, oxidative damage, and intracellular aggregation of proteins and nucleic acids. This work highlights the potential of polyamine-functionalized peptoids for developing next-generation antimicrobial agents and provides insights into the design principles for enhancing their efficacy and safety.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are widely detected in water, air, and food, raising increasing concerns about human exposure. Although growing toxicological evidence suggests that MPs can disrupt gastrointestinal function, their association with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk in humans remains underexplored. This case-control study examined the relationship between fecal MP concentrations and CRC risk in a Chinese population. A total of 258 CRC patients and 493 healthy controls were recruited from the Environmental Exposure and Human Health cohort at Quzhou People's Hospital. Fecal MP concentrations were quantified using Laser Infrared Imaging Spectrometer. The median MP concentration was significantly higher in CRC cases than in controls (62 vs. 43 items/g dry weight, p < 0.05). Multivariable logistic regression showed that individuals in the highest exposure quartile had an adjusted odds ratio of 11.3 (95 % CI: 6.77-19.5, p for trend < 0.01) compared to those in the lowest quartile. Restricted cubic spline analysis indicated a nonlinear dose-response relationship. Stratified analyses indicated that this association was particularly pronounced among females and individuals who frequently consumed spicy or high-fat foods. These findings provide first epidemiological evidence of a potential link between elevated MP exposure and CRC risk.

AB  - Lactoferrin is known to exhibit broad spectrum activity against a multitude of bacteria, fungi, and viruses due to its multi-functional mode of action. Recently, Lactea Therapeutics and its affiliates have developed a novel, patent-pending technology to purify naturally derived bovine lactoferrin (Lactea Lf) for use as a medical countermeasure that was not previously available. To assess the efficacy of Lactea Lf against biothreat pathogens, we performed biofilm inhibition assays and generated dose-response curves against

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of varying levels of synbiotic supplementation on the growth performance and intestinal physiology of broiler chickens. A total of 360-day-old broiler chicks were randomly assigned to six different treatments, with four replicates per treatment and 15 birds per replicate. The control treatment was not supplemented, while the remaining treatments were supplemented with four different levels (0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 g/kg) of synbiotic to the basal diets. The treatments were as follows: (1) control (not any supplement), (2) zinc bacitracin 0.04 g/kg, and (3) the remaining four treatments, which were supplemented with four different levels of synbiotic. On days 10, 24 and 35, the feed remaining and the birds were weighed in order to measure the body weight, weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio. On day 10 and throughout the experimental period, there was a significant increase (P<0.05) in both body weight and weight gain, as well as a significant improvement in feed conversion ratio (FCR) with rising level of synbiotic. The control group exhibited a poorer feed conversion ratio than the other experimental groups (P<0.05). Up to 10 days, there was a significant increase in feed intake in birds on diets supplemented with 0.25 and 0.75 g/kg synbiotic. However, when the data from the 35-day experimental period were analyzed, it was found that the birds that had received 0.75 g/kg of synbiotic had significantly (P<0.05) decreased feed intake compared to the other experimental groups. The relative weight of the internal organs was not affected by the dietary treatments. The carcass yield and breast meat were found to increase significantly (P<0.05) with rising levels of dietary synbiotic. The length of the villi was found to be significantly affected by the treatment, with the villi in birds on diets supplemented with 0.5 g/kg of synbiotic being longer than those in the control group. Significantly, the shortest villi were observed in birds that received the highest supplement level (1 g/kg) of synbiotic. The number of Escherichia coli in the ileum was not affected by the dietary treatments. It can be concluded that synbiotic dietary supplementation exerts beneficial effects on growth output at an early age and during the broiler development cycle. In terms of performance, synbiotics supplementation resulted in an improvement in performance and a positive effect on carcass yield and breast meat production. The current research has demonstrated that the administration of synbiotics at a dosage of 0.75 g/kg exerts beneficial effects on the efficiency and subsequent physiological processes of broilers during the course of their growth.

AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales infections are associated with high mortality rates. Ertapenem is recommended as one of the first-line drugs due to its efficacy against these pathogens. However, physiological changes in critically ill patients may influence drug pharmacokinetics. Thus, this study aims to optimize the ertapenem dosage regimen for critically ill patients in both efficacy and neurotoxicity. The previously reported population pharmacokinetic model and drug-albumin binding model were used for Monte Carlo simulation. A total of 10 ertapenem dosage regimens were performed in 10,000 simulated critically ill patients with varying degrees of renal function and serum albumin. A PTA of achieving 100% for time of free drug above the minimum inhibitory concentration (fT>MIC) was assessed for efficacy. A PTA of achieving a total drug ≥ 11.77 mg/L was determined for neurotoxicity. A usual recommended dosing of 1 g every 24 h can ensure a PTA > 80% for efficacy only in patients having a creatinine clearance of 30-59 mL/min with unlikely neurotoxic risk (a PTA < 2%). Moreover, the study highlights the need for an individualized ertapenem dosage regimen based on renal function in critically ill patients, as ertapenem in divided doses might be more optimal for both efficacy and safety compared to once daily dosing in patients with creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these dose recommendations.

AB  - Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen responsible for listeriosis, a serious disease with high mortality rates, particularly affecting vulnerable populations. Its resilience to environmental stresses, such as pH and cold temperatures, makes it a critical public health concern. Baby fruit purees are high acidic food products that are often the first foods to be introduced as variety in babies' diet. In the case of partial consumption of fruit purees, consumer practices may influence exposure of infants to L. monocytogenes in the event of accidental contamination. The purpose of the study was to investigate the survival of L. monocytogenes in fruit purees under various storage conditions and previous growth conditions, simulating consumer practices. L. monocytogenes 10403S grown at 10 °C (fridge), 25 °C (ambient) or 37 °C (control) at pH 5.5 or 7.2, was inoculated in fruit puree and stored at 10 °C, 25 °C, and 37 °C. Decimal reduction times obtained from fitting inactivation data to the log-linear model, were significantly influenced by storage temperature, showing a protective effect of refrigerated temperature, with extended survival times (mean D

AB  - Macrophages initiate pathogen-appropriate immune responses with the activation dynamics of transcription factor NFκB mediating specificity. Live-cell imaging revealed the stimulus-response specificity of NFκB dynamics among populations of heterogeneous cells. To study stimulus-response specificity beyond what is experimentally accessible, we develop mathematical model simulations that capture the heterogeneity of stimulus-responsive NFκB dynamics and the stimulus-response specificity performance of the population. Complementing experimental data, extended-dose response simulations improved channel capacity estimates. By collapsing parameter distributions, we locate information loss to receptor modules, while the negative-feedback-containing core module shows remarkable signaling fidelity. Further, constructing virtual single-cell networks reveals the stimulus-response specificity of single cells. We find that despite stimulus-response specificity limitations at the population level, the majority of single cells are capable of responding specifically to immune threats, and that the few instances of stimulus-pair confusion are highly uncorrelated. The diversity of blindspots enable small consortia of macrophages to achieve perfect stimulus distinction.

AB  - In response to the rising challenge of pathogen resistance to anti-infective therapies, innovative approaches such as host-directed therapy are being investigated to bypass these resistance mechanisms. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is a crucial enzyme for synthesizing pyrimidines, which are essential for RNA and DNA biosynthesis. Inhibiting DHODH can deplete the nucleotide pool, thereby impairing the replication of pathogens that depend on this pathway. In this study, we evaluated a library of fragment-like compounds against human DHODH (HsDHODH) and identified a 1,2-diarylethine scaffold as a potential new inhibitor. Utilizing the predicted binding mode and the activity of fragments 3a and 3l against HsDHODH, we designed and synthesized 14 novel diarylethine derivatives focused on improving their potency against the enzyme.

AB  - Here we reported a unique class of new structural thiazolylcyanovinyl benzopyridone acids (TBAs) with large potential to defeat the intractable global bacterial resistance. Some prepared TBAs demonstrated broad-spectrum antibacterial ability, especially ethyl TBA 7b gave low MIC values of 0.25-0.5 μg/mL against all the tested bacteria, superior to norfloxacin and clinafloxacin. The highly active molecule 7b not only showed imperceptible hemolysis, cytotoxicity, toxicity in vivo and drug resistance, but also effectually eradicated mature biofilm and rapidly sterilized Klebsiella pneumonia. Moreover, TBA 7b exhibited high therapeutic efficacy in mouse model of wound infection. Mechanism explorations implied that TBA 7b could intercalate into DNA and act on gyrase-DNA complex to block DNA supercoiling, trigger oxidative stress and inhibit lactate dehydrogenase to reduce metabolism, resulting in bacterial death and intracellular protein leakage. These results suggested that thiazolylcyanovinyl benzopyridone acids should hold the large promise for being exploited as next-generation antibacterial oxcains.

AB  - Widespread detection of xanthate vulcanization accelerators (XVAs) in various dust samples underscores the inherent risk of their human exposure. Notably, comprehensive investigations into the presence and concentrations of XVAs in human urine, a medium particularly suited for calculating human exposure, are still lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic examination of eight XVA homologues in urine specimens obtained from 218 healthy adults residing in urban Taizhou City, China. We found that all targeted XVA compounds were identified in collected human urine samples, with potassium butylxanthate (KBX; mean 32 ng/mL, range < LOD-120 ng/mL) and potassium amylxanthate (KAX; 26 ng/mL, < LOD-91 ng/mL) exhibiting the highest mean urinary levels. Males consistently demonstrated higher mean urinary concentrations of KAX, potassium propylxanthate (KPX), and potassium ethylxanthogenate (KEX) compared with females, though these differences did not reach statistical significance. Notably, age-related decreases in human urinary concentrations were observed for KAX, KBX, and KEX. The highest daily exposure (DE) was recorded for KBX at the average level of 906 ng/kg bw/day, ranging from < 38-3056 ng/kg bw/day. KAX exhibited a mean DE of 718 ng/kg bw/day (< 14 -2048 ng/kg bw/day), while KPX showed a mean DE of 403 ng/kg bw/day (< 26 -213 ng/kg bw/day). As the first comprehensive analysis of XVAs in human urine samples, this research establishes fundamental exposure data essential for evaluating their health implications.

AB  - Understanding how multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria and fungi defy the existing antimicrobial agents requires innovative tools and techniques for real-time, in situ exploration of bacterial responses to antibiotics. Fluorescence-tagged antibiotics or dyes with inherent antimicrobial activity can provide a profound understanding of the molecular biology underlying antibiotic action and resistance mechanisms. Cutting-edge research highlights the pursuit of benzo-α-pyrone (coumarin) derivatives due to their excellent pharmacokinetics, diverse pharmacological activities, and innovative fluorescence molecular probes. In this study, donor-π-acceptor-based coumarin dyes were designed and evaluated for antimicrobial efficacy against fungal strains (Candida albicans), Gram-negative pathogens (Escherichia coli), and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus). I-6 exhibited notable antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and C. albicans compared with E. coli. Conversely, I-9, a congener of I-6, showed a comparable affinity for S. aureus but found poor activity against the remaining tested strains. Mechanistic investigative studies unveiled that the inhibitory efficacy of I-6 can be attributed to its capacity to generate high reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Despite the evident antimicrobial potential of I-6 in the data, our future prospects, including real-time visualization to study physiological processes like uptake, distribution, and mechanism of action through fluorescence-based imaging modalities, could enhance the applicability of these probes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption modulates immune function, in part by promoting microbial translocation. This process is thought to trigger an acute-phase immune response, contributing to alcohol-related immune modulation. However, most evidence on these effects arises from preclinical models. Additionally, existing human studies lack a placebo control, rely on a single alcohol dose, or fail to account for individual drinking history. METHODS: This study examined in vivo concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a marker of microbial translocation), acute-phase proteins, cytokines, and chemokines under low-dose alcohol, moderate-dose alcohol, and placebo using a within-subjects design in light and heavy drinkers. Participants (N = 32) were light drinkers (n = 15) and nontreatment-seeking heavy drinkers (n = 17). Groups did not differ on demographics. Participants received each dose condition in randomized order. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at hourly intervals for 4 h. Plasma concentrations of LPS, acute-phase proteins (LPS binding protein [LBP], soluble cluster of differentiation 14 [sCD14], and soluble cluster of differentiation 163 [sCD163]), and cytokines/chemokines (interleukin 6 [IL-6], interleukin 8 [IL-8], interleukin 10 [IL-10], monocyte chemoattractant protein [MCP-1], and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α]) were quantified using immunoassays. Linear mixed models tested effects of dose condition, drinker group, time, and the three-way interaction. Further analyses tested associations of LPS, LBP, sCD14, and sCD163 with cytokines/chemokines. RESULTS: The three-way interaction of dose by group by time was significant for IL-6 (p = 0.042), IL-8 (p = 0.039), MCP-1 (p = 0.001), and TNF-α (p = 0.001). LPS was associated with concentrations of interleukins. Levels of sCD163 were 43% higher in heavy drinkers overall. Heavy drinkers exhibited apparent conditioned peripheral immune suppression, wherein the expectation of alcohol elicited selective immunosuppressive responses. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers novel in vivo evidence that alcohol-induced changes in immune function are dependent on both acute dose and chronic drinking behavior.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the association between dietary riboflavin (vitamin B2) intake and Helicobacter pylori infection prevalence among U.S. adults, addressing the growing interest in nutritional strategies for microbial pathogenesis modulation. METHODS: We analyzed data from 2,895 participants in the 1999-2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) with complete dietary and H. pylori serology records. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic, clinical, and nutritional covariates were employed to assess riboflavin-infection relationships. Dose-response patterns were evaluated using restricted cubic splines, and subgroup analyses tested heterogeneity across population strata. RESULTS: The overall H. pylori seropositivity rate was 44.2%. Higher riboflavin intake exhibited a dose-dependent inverse association with infection risk. Compared to the lowest quartile (Q1 ≤ 1.13 mg/day), adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) for Q2 (1.14-1.64 mg/day), Q3 (1.65-2.34 mg/day), and Q4 (≥2.35 mg/day) were 0.77 (0.60-0.99), 0.63 (0.48-0.84), and 0.62 (0.41-0.94), respectively. Spline analysis confirmed a near-linear risk reduction with increasing intake. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that dietary riboflavin may inversely correlate with H. pylori infection in a dose-responsive manner, potentially mediated through mitochondrial function preservation, oxidative stress reduction, and gut microbiota modulation. While observational design precludes causal inference, the results underscore the need for prospective studies evaluating riboflavin's role in infection prevention.

AB  - Periodic evaluation of particulate contaminants in raw/untreated water is integral to assessing risk, establishing treatment requirements, and ensuring drinking water safety. However, pathogenic microorganisms and other discrete particles (e.g., microplastics) are not typically monitored with any regularity. When monitoring is required, recommended, or proactively used to evaluate the adequacy of treatment or assess treatment needs, there is a need for guidance on how to collect data and use them to maximize return on investment. The potentially increasing variability in source water quality associated with climate change emphasizes the importance of knowing contaminant concentrations to effectively manage risks. This work presents a framework to guide the development of monitoring protocols for particulate contaminants in water and the integration of monitoring data and quantitative microbial risk assessment into treatment decisions. The protozoa monitoring and risk-based compliance approach of a drinking water utility in Canada is presented along with 7 years of data. Guidance for determining sampling frequencies and locations is provided. It is shown that

AB  - Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) is an economically important aquaculture species in China. Aeromonas veronii (A. veronii), a conditional pathogen, causes substantial economic losses in largemouth bass farming. Valine (Val), an essential amino acid for fish, plays a crucial role in the growth of largemouth bass; however, its effects on liver health under A. veronii infection remain unclear. This study investigated the influence of dietary Val on hepatic antioxidant capacity, inflammatory response, apoptosis, and autophagy in largemouth bass following A. veronii challenge. A total of 720 juveniles (37.99 ± 0.01 g) were fed six isonitrogenous diets with graded levels of Val (11.0-26.1 g/kg diet) for 11 weeks, and the fish were subjected to a 7 d challenge trial with A. veronii. Results showed that dietary Val supplementation (20.1 g/kg) effectively mitigated A. veronii-induced histopathological damage, notably attenuating both necrotic changes and inflammatory infiltration. Mechanistically, dietary Val enhanced hepatic antioxidant capacity by activating the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway, significantly increasing antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD1, CAT, GST, GPx, GR, GCLC) and reducing oxidative stress markers (ROS, MDA, PC) (P < 0.05); Dietary Val attenuated apoptosis through downregulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers (GRP78, ATF6, IRE1, PERK, eIF2α, ATF4, CHOP) and modulation of Bcl2/Bax ratio (P < 0.05); Dietary Val suppressed excessive autophagy as evidenced by decreased expression of key autophagy-related genes (ULK1, ATG9, BECN1, ATG7, ATG5, LC3) and proteins (P < 0.05). Dietary Val regulated inflammatory responses by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β) while promoting anti-inflammatory factors (TGF-β2, IL-10). These findings demonstrate Val's multifaceted hepatoprotective effects through coordinated regulation of oxidative stress, apoptosis and autophagy pathways in A. veronii-infected largemouth bass.

AB  - It is a fact that the presence of antioxidants reduces the damage caused by free radicals, which could be linked to cancer development. Antibacterial activity is also linked proportionally to the antioxidant level. So, taking into consideration the above-stated facts, some novel 2-{4-[5-(substituted-phenyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrazol-3-yl]-phenoxy}-1-[4-(substituted-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-ethanones (9a-z) have been synthesized and were evaluated for their anticancer, antibacterial, and antioxidant potential through established in-vitro and in-silico screening models. In vitro activity, which was performed against human lung cancer cell line 'A549' via MTT assay, established that all the target compounds exhibited potent preferential inhibition, but compounds 9b, 9m, and 9w were found to be the best and most potent cytotoxic agents with an IC

AB  - The increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections underscores the urgent need for novel antimicrobial agents with distinct mechanisms. In this study, we present the rational design and synthesis of cationic amphiphilic cannabichromene (CBC, 1) derivatives that mimic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Structural optimization of CBC through the incorporation of quaternary ammonium cations improved hydrophilicity and expanded the antibacterial spectrum. Among the 35 derivatives, compound 11F emerged as the lead candidate, exhibiting potent activity against Gram-positive (MIC = 0.25-0.5 μg/mL) and Gram-negative pathogens (MIC = 0.5-8 μg/mL), surpassing vancomycin and ceftazidime in efficacy. Mechanistic studies revealed that 11F disrupts bacterial membranes through high-affinity binding to phosphatidylglycerol (PG), resulting in membrane permeabilization and cytoplasmic leakage. Molecular dynamics simulations supported its membrane-targeting mechanism, driven by amphiphilic insertion into lipid bilayers. The synergistic accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) further amplified the bactericidal effects. Compound 11F demonstrated low hemolysis and cytotoxicity, showing in vivo efficacy in a murine MRSA sepsis model (98.8 % bacterial reduction at 10 mg/kg) and displaying excellent safety. This study establishes compound 11F as a promising membrane-active antibacterial agent with potential for translation into clinical use against MDR infections.

AB  - Dual inhibition of the negative p53 regulators MDM2 and MDMX has emerged as an effective strategy in p53-based anticancer therapy. However, dual inhibitors are limited, and many inhibitors exhibit poor pharmacokinetic properties and fast dissociation kinetics. Among newly identified microbial metabolites, the novel phenylalanine-derived compound P5 isolated from Micromonospora sp. MS-62 (FBCC-B8445) exhibits inhibitory activity against both MDM2 and MDMX. The binding of P5 to MDM2 and MDMX is demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance, which reveals nanomolar-level affinity and slow dissociation kinetics (KD = 46 nM for MDM2; 576 nM for MDMX). This dual inhibitory activity was further supported by molecular docking, which reveals binding of P5 to the p53-binding pockets of both MDM2 and MDMX through extensive noncovalent interactions. In cell-based assays, P5 reduced cancer cell viability across several human cell lines. Furthermore, in silico analysis indicates favorable pharmacokinetic properties, including gastrointestinal absorption, blood-brain barrier permeability, and compliance with Lipinski's and Veber's criteria. P5 combines dual-target engagement with binding persistence and favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics, addressing limitations of earlier inhibitors. P5 is a potential lead compound for the development of MDM2/MDMX-targeted anticancer agents.

AB  - Fungal pathogen infections impose a great challenge for global public health, causing approximately 1.6 million deaths annually. Echinocandin-class drugs, with unique mechanism and favorable safety profile, have become the first-line anti-fungal therapeutic option for candidemia and invasive candidiasis. The present study successfully designed and synthesized a series of novel echinocandin derivatives, among which SIPI-18333 and SIPI-18334 exhibited a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.03125 μg/mL against Candida krusei in vitro, significantly surpassing existing echinocandin drugs. Furthermore, these optimized compounds demonstrated minimal dependence on CYP450 metabolism in liver microsomes, resulting in significantly reduced risk of drug-drug interactions. Meanwhile, plasma stability experiments indicated that the optimized compounds exhibited better stability in plasma compared with Micafungin. Subsequent pharmacokinetic studies in rats showed significantly higher plasma exposure levels [Cmax, AUC(0-t)] of the optimized compounds than those of Rezafungin. To sum up, SIPI-18333 and SIPI-18334 exhibit superior anti-fungal activity and enhanced bioavailability, which are promising candidates for the next-generation anti-fungal agents and warrant further development.

AB  - Campylobacter is a major cause of foodborne illness worldwide, and poultry products are considered as the main source of campylobacteriosis. This study provides insight into the hygienic practices of handling raw chicken at home in the Netherlands and quantifies the impact of these practices on the incidence of campylobacteriosis in a quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA), with a specific focus on the number of illness cases rather than the risk per serving. A survey was conducted among Dutch consumers (n = 1974) to assess their raw chicken handling practices. The results showed that 95 % of consumers reported always or often thoroughly cooking chicken, indicating high compliance with safe practices. However, less safe practices were also reported, such as washing chicken before preparation (36 %) or replacing dishcloths once a week or less (23 %). Demographic analyses showed that females followed safe food-handling practices better than males, and respondents from households with children or with pregnant household members adhered better to safe practices than households without these characteristics. Quantitative experiments were conducted to measure the cross-contamination and transfer rate of Campylobacter jejuni from raw chicken fillet to cucumber. Replacing the cutting board resulted in a 75 % decrease in the transfer rate, while replacing the knife led to a 57 % reduction, both compared to the worst-case scenario of no replacement of cutleries. The QMRA predicted that the primary factor contributing to the risk of campylobacteriosis was the initial concentration. Scenario analysis highlighted thorough cooking as the most impactful intervention at home for reducing Campylobacter infection, followed by hand washing after handling raw chicken meat and replacing cutting boards. Sustained efforts to lower initial contamination levels, combined with targeted communication and improved consumer practices on hygienic measures, can effectively reduce the incidence and public health impact of foodborne illnesses associated with chicken consumption.

AB  - The oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)-related protein 1 (ORP1) serves as a critical target for oomycete inhibitors, given that OSBPI fungicides demonstrate exceptionally high biological efficacy through their specific binding to the ORD domain of ORP1. Our previous research has demonstrated that the PH domain of ORP1 in Phytophthora species plays a crucial role in its biological functions. However, the potential of this domain as a viable target for fungicides remains to be elucidated. In this study, we describe the discovery of the PH domain inhibitor, compound X4. Initially, a hit compound VS-07, with good fungicidal activity against oomycetes, was identified through docking-based virtual screening. Subsequently, 27 analogs were designed and synthesized by structurally optimizing of VS-07. Among these, compound X4 demonstrated exceptional inhibitory activities against six oomycetes, with EC

AB  - BACKGROUND: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has emerged as a critical global health burden, driven by rising prevalence rates and earlier disease onset. Current therapeutic strategies remain limited to lifestyle interventions, with no approved pharmacotherapies targeting disease progression. Growing evidence highlights gut microbiota dysbiosis as a pivotal contributor to MASLD pathogenesis, characterized by disrupted intestinal barrier function, endotoxin translocation, and dysregulated bile acid (BA) and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism. Preclinical studies suggest that specific botanical drugs and standardized polyherbal formulations may mitigate MASLD through microbiota modulation. METHODS: A systematic review of preclinical and clinical studies (2015-2025) was conducted across PubMed, Web of Science, and CNKI. Search terms included "gut microbiota," "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)," and "MASLD," focusing on studies with chemically defined botanical metabolites (purity >90%) or rigorously characterized polyherbal formulations. Exclusion criteria eliminated reports lacking microbial taxonomic validation (e.g., 16S rRNA sequencing), dose-response relationships, or mechanistic validation in animal models. RESULTS: The synthesis of studies reveals that TCM ameliorates MASLD through three interconnected mechanisms: restoration of gut microbial diversity, reinforcement of intestinal barrier integrity via tight junction protein upregulation (e.g., ZO-1 and occludin), and normalization of BA/SCFA metabolism. Among the 10 botanical drugs and 11 formulations reviewed, significant reduction in liver steatosis were shown in rodent models. However, only 4% of these interventions progressed to human trials, and critical methodological inconsistencies were observed, including inconsistent phytochemical standardization and overreliance on homogeneous animal models (68% using male C57BL/6 mice). CONCLUSION: While TCM shows promise in modulating microbiota-liver crosstalk, clinical translation is hindered by insufficient phytochemical standardization, unvalidated multi-component synergies, and a paucity of human efficacy data. To bridge this gap, future research must prioritize randomized controlled trials with liver histology endpoints, ConPhyMP-guided quality control protocols, and humanized microbiota models. Rigorous validation of TCM's microbiota-centric mechanisms-rather than empirical applications-will be essential to advance these interventions into clinically actionable therapies for MASLD.

AB  - Diabetic wounds complicated by bacterial infections present a significant clinical challenge, and cause a great burden to the world's health care systems. Infections by bacteria, especially drug-resistant bacteria, is the major underlying factor leading to diabetic wounds. Here, we synthesized a series of fluoroborane dipyrrole compounds that can be activated under ambient light conditions, and identified one compound with potent antibacterial action. The compound has a maximum absorption wavelength of 538 nm, close to the maximum emission wavelength of sunlight, making it particularly suitable for incorporation into transparent antimicrobial patches. We fabricated such a patch and evaluated its therapeutic potential in a murine model of diabetic wounds infected with drug-resistant bacteria. The experimental results showed that the patch not only eradicates drug-resistant bacterial strains but also promoted wound healing under ambient light. Furthermore, the compound exhibited a high level of biosafety. This work developed an effective and safe method to combat bacterial skin infections associated with diabetic wounds.

AB  - HIV continues to affect people every day and is still considered a global pandemic. Due to the absence of a cure or a vaccine, patients are subjected to a life-long treatment that is often complicated by antiviral drug resistance, highlighting the need to develop new therapies. One of the key targets for this antiviral drug development is reverse transcriptase. In this paper, we describe the discovery, synthesis and biological evaluation of a novel chemotype of potent 3,4-dihydroquinazolin-2(1H)-one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Several compounds exhibit nanomolar antiviral activity against wild-type (WT) human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and maintain an excellent activity profile against various clinically relevant mutations. These promising first results provide an exciting foundation for further research into this novel NNRTI scaffold.

AB  - Cefuroxime is a second-generation cephalosporin widely used in the intensive care unit (ICU). ICU patients have high variability in interpatient pharmacokinetics (PK), but the extent of this variation is unclear. We performed an observational PK study in ICU patients. The objective of this study was to gain knowledge on the PK of cefuroxime and investigate target attainment of currently clinically applied dosing regimens. To identify the most suitable regimen the time above the minimal inhibitory concentration of the unbound drug (%fT > MIC) was calculated for different minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and estimated Glomerular Filtration rates (eGFRs). Twenty patients were included with an average age of 66 years and modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) (not indexed by BSA) of 90 [60-117.5] mL/min. A two-compartment model best fitted the data, with eGFR as a covariate. Probability of target attainment (PTA) was 43% for a 1500-mg q8h bolus dosage for the EUCAST break point of 8 mg/L for a typical individual with a eGFR of 60 mL/min. Dosing continuously using 4.5 g/day obtained 100% PTA for a typical individual with a eGFR up to 120 mL/min.

AB  - This study reports the synthesis and assessment of a series of imide derivatives of phthalic anhydride (phthalimides) for their potential antimicrobial activities. Phthalic acid was first converted into phthalic anhydride using acetic anhydride, which was then reacted with various L-amino acids to obtain phthalimides in high yields. Compounds HUPB, HUPC, HUPF, and HUPH exhibited promising antimicrobial activity, with HUPF and HUPH being the most potent. HUPF exhibited significant antimicrobial activity, showing inhibition zones of 24 mm versus Staphylococcus aureus (at 2000 µg/mL), 17 mm versus Escherichia coli (at 2000 µg/mL), and 18 mm against Candida albicans (at 1000 µg/mL). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were 16 µg/mL, 24 µg/mL, and 24 µg/mL for S. aureus, E. coli, and C. albicans, respectively. HUPH demonstrated strong antimicrobial activity, exhibiting inhibition zones of 23 mm versus S. aureus, 19 mm versus E. coli, and 20 mm versus C. albicans, with corresponding MICs of 20 µg/mL, 28 µg/mL, and 20 µg/mL, respectively. Molecular docking reinforced these results, demonstrating effective bindings for HUPF and HUPH, suggesting their potential as antimicrobial agents. Both compounds adhered to Lipinski's Rule of Five, signifying decent oral bioavailability, gastrointestinal absorption (≥0.55), and no PAINS (pan-assay interference compounds) alerts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that HUPF and HUPH possess narrow HOMO-LUMO energy gaps and elevated dipole moments, indicating high chemical reactivity, and strong polarity, which further support their enhanced antimicrobial potential. These results highlight the therapeutic potential of the two compounds for further development as novel antimicrobial agents.

AB  - Genetic regulation tools have been examined for their ability to enable sophisticated dynamic control of biosynthesis in microbial cell factories, enhancing the production performance of valuable compounds. However, most genetic tools are pathway- or intermediate-specific, hindering their broad applicability in synthetic biology. Moreover, their potential to balance metabolic fluxes in central metabolism between cell growth and product formation remains under-explored, raising the question of whether they can facilitate efficient biosynthesis. To answer this, we established the PdhR biosensor system that responds to pyruvate to dynamically regulate metabolic flux distribution in central metabolism. In this study, we first characterized the dose response of PdhR biosensor system by screening multiple PdhR homologs derived from various microorganisms. Computational analysis further guided the identification of key factors contributing to their functional differences, enabling the optimization of biosensor properties through site-directed mutagenesis. As proof of concept, we employed our biosensor system to improve the biosynthesis of trehalose and 4-hydroxycoumarin (4HC), respectively. Specifically, trehalose titer increased to 3.72 g/L, which is 2.33-fold higher than the control group. In addition, we improved the 4HC titer to 491.5 mg/L, which possessed a 1.63-fold increase over the static strategy. In summary, the established central metabolism-responsive biosensor system underlined the necessity of metabolic flux distribution and validated its broad applicability in the biosynthesis of central metabolism-derived compounds.

AB  - Copper Oxide Nanoparticles (CuONPs) contain medicinal properties and are an essential component of the next generation due to their unique properties. CuONPs have a vital role in therapeutics, especially for cancer treatment. This study's main focus was synthesizing the CuONPs and assessing the anti-cancer activity, including the in vitro anti-angiogenesis and cytotoxicity analyses. CuONPs are synthesized using the enzymatic suspension of endophytic fungal strains FCSRL3 and FCPRS11 isolated from the Azadirachta indica grown in a minimal medium at optimum pH 7.2. About 14 different endophytic fungi confined from the neem tree, and the antagonistic and antioxidant properties were evaluated. The efficient FCSRL3 and FCPRS11 were identified as Aspergillus sydowi and Aspergillus versicolor at a molecular level. The synthesized CuONPs from two fungi were confirmed through characterization determination using SEM, EDAX, FT-IR, and XRD analyses. CuONPs revealed maximum antibacterial, antimycotic, and antioxidant activities at minimum concentration, exerting the highest bioactive properties. The anti-angiogenic activity of the CuONPs from two different fungal strains exhibited maximum inhibition of blood vessels in chick embryos, and the assessment was performed using HET-CAM. The outcomes of this research demonstrate the notable role of CuONPs in cancer remedies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality worldwide, with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) being particularly fatal. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a key treatment for ACS; however, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) frequently occur postoperatively. Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a gut microbiota-derived metabolite, has been proposed as an emerging risk factor for cardiovascular disease. This study aims to systematically evaluate TMAO's predictive value for MACE post-PCI and explore its dose-response relationship. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in four databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library), including retrospective or prospective cohort studies involving patients undergoing PCI. The primary outcome was MACE, and the secondary outcome was all-cause mortality. A dose-response analysis was conducted using a restricted cubic spline model to explore potential nonlinear associations between TMAO levels and outcomes. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane Q test and the I² statistic. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were performed to identify sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Eleven studies (comprising 13 independent cohorts) with 11,279 participants were included. Pooled analysis showed a significant association between elevated plasma TMAO levels and an increased risk of MACE after PCI (HR: 1.99, 95%CI: 1.68-2.35, 95%PI: 1.64-2.40, I² = 0%, p < 0.00001). Similarly, elevated plasma TMAO levels were significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality after PCI (HR: 1.76, 95%CI: 1.32-2.35, 95%PI: 0.79-3.90, I² = 65.1%, p < 0.00001). The dose-response analysis did not reveal a nonlinear relationship between TMAO and MACE or all-cause mortality. The linear model showed that each 1 µmol/L increase in plasma TMAO was associated with an 8.95% increased hazard of MACE (HR = 1.0895, 95%CI: 1.03-1.15), while all-cause mortality increased by 4% (HR = 1.04, 95%CI: 0.99-1.09). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that elevated plasma TMAO levels are significantly associated with an increased risk of MACE and all-cause mortality after PCI, with a dose-dependent effect on MACE risk. As a potential biomarker, TMAO may be used to predict the risk of adverse cardiovascular events after PCI, and future studies should further validate its clinical utility.

AB  - The major drinking water reservoirs and catchments supplying many of Australia's capital cities have been protected from significant levels of public access since their construction (up to 140 years ago). In addition to the primary intended initial benefit, (protecting drinking water quality to prevent typhoid and similar disease outbreaks), additional benefits included reduced flooding, improved and more stable yield, reduced water treatment costs, and protection of native ecosystems. In relation to the latter benefit, over that period, much of the Australian landscape has been modified for various forms of development and recreational activities, leaving these water catchments as some of the last broad areas of remnant habitat for vulnerable and endangered ecosystems and species. Despite these widely appreciated and well-understood benefits, there has been continuous pressure from a diverse range of interest groups to open these areas. As government-owned organisations, the Australian water utilities consider all such requests from the community. Among the interest groups that make representations to access drinking water sources are a wide range of recreators. Pressure from such groups is increasing as populations grow. To help inform decisions on how to respond to such representations, this study predicted gastrointestinal disease burdens from recreation on a currently protected drinking water supply reservoir in Australia. This study considered a range of scenarios, described in terms understandable to the community, and predicted health implications using screening-level quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA). The assessment was limited to microbial risks to drinking water quality - risks from chemical or physical hazards were not considered, nor was ecosystem protection. The QMRA predicted that six reasonably foreseeable scenarios could result in microbial risks that exceeded the health-based target benchmark given in the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines (ADWG). Therefore, additional water treatment would be required to reduce those risks to acceptable levels. However, even with the introduction of additional treatment, permitting increases in the levels of recreational activity in the source water was found to be inconsistent with many of the Guiding Principles of the ADWG and with a landmark state Supreme Court planning decision that had interpreted how those principles should be applied in drinking water catchments. Therefore, the results did not support permitting recreational access to the reservoir, and the importance of source protection was reinforced.

AB  - Marine macroalgae has the potential to improve growth performance in broiler chickens due to the presence of bioactive compounds. This study examined the effects of a red seaweed (SW) powder, from Chondracanthus chamissoi, on the growth performance, intestinal morphology, and cecal microbiota of broiler chickens. A total of 256 male Cobb-500 broiler chicks were housed in battery cages and allocated on d 0 post hatching to 4 diets for 21 days in a randomized complete block design consisting of 8 replicate cages and 8 birds per replicate. The 4 diets included a corn-soybean-based diet (basal diet), or the basal diet supplemented with 0.5 %, 1 %, or 1.5 % SW. Body weight (BW) and feed intake (FI) were recorded weekly. On d 7, 14, and 21 post hatching, SW diets linearly increased the BW gain of birds (P < 0.01), but the gain-to-feed ratio (G: F) was not affected by the treatments except from day 0 to 7 (P < 0.05). Dietary SW linearly increased the feed intake throughout the experiment (P < 0.05). Dietary SW increased (P < 0.05) the ileal villus height to crypt depth ratio (VH: CD) and showed a tendency (P = 0.08) to linearly increase ileal villus height (VH). Additionally, dietary SW increased both jejunal VH and the VH: CD ratio (P < 0.05). No differences were observed in alpha diversity metrics; however, beta diversity analysis showed variations in the composition of the microbial community. Differential abundance showed that Bifidobacterium, and Butyricicoccus were abundant taxa in the SW diets. In conclusion, graded inclusions of SW improved the growth performance of broiler chickens when fed for 21 days, by altering the intestinal morphology and microbiota. However, the nutrient digestibility was not improved by seaweed.

AB  - In-ovo supplements are commonly used to improve embryonic and chick development performance. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of different Nigella Sativa nanoparticle (NS-Nano) levels in ovo on hatchability and ostrich chick performance. Four hundred and fifty fertilized ostrich eggs were randomly distributed into six experimental groups: NCN, un-injection eggs, ISS, ovo injected with 0.7 % saline solution, and four levels of Nigella Sativa nanoparticles (10, 25, 50, and 75 μg/egg), respectively, on day 37 into the amniotic fluid at embryonic. After injection, standard hatching conditions were followed and hatchability and chick quality measurements were taken. After hatching, twenty-five chicks from each group were weighed, randomly distributed into five replicates, and raised for 8 weeks. The results showed that supplementing with 50 and 75 μg NS-Nano enhanced hatchability and chick quality compared to other injected groups. However, the chick weight did not differ between experimental groups. Additionally, the growth performance improved in ostriches received 50 μg NS-Nano, as the body weight increased and the feed conversion ratio decreased (P<0.05) compared to the other groups. Furthermore, plasma levels of superoxide oxidase (SOD), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and IL-10 increased, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels decreased in ostrich chicks receiving 50 and 75 μg NS-Nano (P<0.05) than those in the other groups. Adding 50 μg NS-Nano enhanced the intestinal integrity of ostrich chicks by increasing Lactobacillus count and reducing pathogenic bacteria (P<0.05), in addition to up-regulation of MUC2 and IGF-1 genes. In conclusion, this study indicated that up to 50 μg of NS-Nano supplementation significantly promoted hatchability, chick quality, immunity, antioxidant capacity, intestinal integrity, and growth performance of ostrich chicks.

AB  - AIM: Chikungunya fever (CHIKF) caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is characterized by the presence of long-term polyarthralgia in a minor proportion of the infected patients. Currently, there are no FDA-approved antivirals available. This study evaluated the anti-CHIKV potential of 16 synthetic 3-amino-2-thiocyanato-α, β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds and elucidated their probable mechanisms of action. METHODS: Anti-CHIKV activity of 16 compounds were investigated in Vero CCL-81 cells using focus forming unit assay (FFU). Dose-dependent and time-dependent antiviral assays were performed for the effective compounds. Molecular docking was performed to find out their interactions with viral proteins. RESULTS: Five compounds showed promising anti-CHIKV activity by reducing viral titer with >1 log CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the in vitro anti-CHIKV activity of these compounds, and their possible mode of action via interference with early stages of infection and replication processes. This study warrants further preclinical and clinical evaluation to establish their safety and efficacy as novel anti-CHIKV therapeutics.

AB  - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) often cause adverse effects, leading to increased interest in the identification of natural compounds with fewer side effects. This study reports the purification and characterization of an alkylated flavonoid, Brevi-inflammin, a novel marine actinobacteria-derived compound that contains anti-inflammatory activity from Brevibacterium casei VRK 1. Using the one-pot synthesis method, the alkylated flavonoid compound Brevi-inflammin was synthesized and purified using semi-preparative reverse-phase HPLC. Further, it is characterized through multiple spectroscopic techniques, including UV-visible spectroscopy, FTIR, HPLC NMR, and UPLC-MS/MS. To assess the anti-inflammatory potential of Brevi-inflammin, the cytotoxic assessment and nitrous oxide inhibitory activity were performed. Further, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were used to evaluate the binding affinity and stability of Brevi-inflammin with a COX-2. Spectroscopic results revealed Brevi-inflammin as an alkylated flavonoid compound, evidenced by its maximum absorption at 230 nm, characteristic aromatic ring structures (CH

AB  - The persistent global health challenges posed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) underscore the urgent need to identify novel antitubercular agents from natural origin. The objective of this research is to assess the antitubercular potential of phytocompounds from Datura innoxia against Mtb through in vitro and in silico methods. Eleven natural compounds were screened for antitubercular activity. The molecular docking and pharmacokinetic properties of the lead compounds were assessed against 10 protein targets. Additionally, density functional theory (DFT), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation were conducted to further evaluate the compound's properties. C-1 (trans-3-indoleacrylic acid) exhibited the strongest antitubercular activity against Mtb H37Ra strain, with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 3.12 μg/mL and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 12.5 μg/mL. C-2 (indole-3-lactic acid) demonstrated the best binding affinity (9.571 kcal/mol), followed by C-1 (-7.467 kcal/mol), particularly with protein PknB (PDB ID: 5U94). In silico ADMET and DFT analyses indicated favorable pharmacokinetics of C-2, and MD simulations further confirmed its stability. C-1 (trans-3-indoleacrylic acid) exhibited the best in vitro activity, while C-2 (indole-3-lactic acid) showed the strongest in silico results. Both candidates are promising agents due to their potent efficacy and favorable stability profiles, and can be used alone or in combination with other antitubercular agents.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the associations between sulfur microbial diet (SMD) and all-cause, cardiovascular disease, and cancer mortality. A total of 91 891 adults were included from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. To evaluate adherence to this dietary pattern, the SMD score was calculated with higher scores indicating greater compliance. The hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards regression. After a median follow-up of 15.0 years, 20 706 all-cause deaths were noted. The participants in the highest quartile of the SMD score had an enhanced risk of death from all causes (HR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.17) and cancer (HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.24) than those in the lowest quartile. Dose-response analysis indicated a nonlinear association between the SMD score and both all-cause and cancer mortality. Subgroup analyses demonstrated a significant positive association between the SMD score and all-cause mortality in participants aged 65 years and older. Higher adherence to the SMD is linked to increased risks of all-cause and cancer mortality in the US population. These study findings suggest that intestinal sulfur-metabolizing bacteria may play a role in the association between diet and health outcomes.

AB  - Recently, the incidence of breast cancer has increased among postmenopausal women. This highlights the need for improved aromatase inhibitors with fewer side effects than those currently available. This study focuses on designing and evaluating potential aromatase inhibitors containing the 1,2,4-triazole/indole hybrid, given their proven impact in this respect. Accordingly, by exploiting the thiol and amine groups in 5-((1H-indole-3-yl)methyl)-4-amino-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol (2) to react with some reagents, new hybrid 1,2,4-triazole-indole compounds were obtained. A cytotoxicity (MTT) test was conducted to assess the anticancer activity of the newly synthesized compounds on the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. The results of the MTT assay indicated that compounds 4d and 5 exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against the MCF-7 cancer cell lines with IC

AB  - A series of 4'-fluoro fleximer nucleoside analogues in addition to their corresponding prodrugs were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their antiviral potential. The impetus for this series was based on the success of other 4'-modified nucleoside antiviral drugs such as adafosbuvir and balapiravir. One analogue, KAD-008, exhibited potent, low single-digit micromolar activity against DENV-2. Another analogue, KAD-025, had broad-spectrum antiviral activity across several viral families including flaviviruses, filoviruses, and coronaviruses. All of the analogues tested showed no toxicity up to 100 µM. Additional studies are underway to elucidate the mechanism of action for these compounds and to synthesize additional 4'-modified fleximer nucleoside analogues with different 4'-modifications to compare their antiviral activities.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: NTB-3119M, a novel benzothiopyranone derivative identified through comprehensive drug development studies, was selected as a promising antituberculosis (anti-TB) candidate. This study systematically evaluated its anti-TB efficacy in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: In vitro analyses encompassed antimicrobial susceptibility testing to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, 10 drug-susceptible clinical isolates, and 30 multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, alongside evaluations of minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) using H37Rv and seven clinical isolates. Additionally, intracellular anti-mycobacterial activity was assessed in H37Rv-infected macrophages, and cytotoxicity was profiled through MTT assays on Vero cells. In vivo studies utilized acute and chronic murine tuberculosis infection models to investigate the dose-dependent efficacy of NTB-3119M (50 and 100 mg/kg) against H37Rv, with concurrent comparative histopathological analysis of lung and spleen tissues. RESULTS: NTB-3119M demonstrated superior in vitro potency against both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains compared to first-line agents, Isoniazid (INH), Rifampicin (RIF), Moxifloxacin (MOFX), Levofloxacin (LVFX), and Streptomycin (SM), exhibiting comparable activity to PBTZ169. Time-kill curves for NTB-3119M indicate its potent bactericidal activity. Meanwhile, No cytotoxicity was observed on Vero cells. Spontaneous resistant mutants of NTB-3119M appears at a frequency of 6.44 × 10 CONCLUSION: Our research provided comprehensive evidence that NTB-3119M with increased water solubility and bioavailability based on previous research performed excellent anti-tuberculosis activity and less cytotoxicity, which effectively tackled the undesirable drug properties associated with previous benzothiopyrone derivatives. It is warranted that NTB-3119M, as a highly promising candidate anti tuberculosis drug, deserves further research and clinical trial.

AB  - Effective control of local dengue virus transmission requires reducing the population of mosquitoes below a critical density threshold. Aedes aegypti density thresholds can serve as targets for intervention effectiveness. Most thresholds have been identified by correlating vector densities with pathogen transmission events. However, despite previous descriptive research there is a need for rigorously controlled field studies to clarify the interactions between Ae. aegypti density and human infections. We report on a multi-arm cluster randomized field trial aimed at determining the number of female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes below which dengue outbreaks are limited. We implemented four mosquito control treatments in a dose-response trial, using zero to three Autocidal Gravid Ovitraps (AGO traps) per house across study neighborhoods in Caguas, Puerto Rico from January 2021 to June 2024. We anticipated that significant reductions in Ae. aegypti populations would indicate a threshold density if low or no prevalence of dengue viruses was observed in mosquitoes or antibodies in residents through IgM and IgG serological testing. Results showed that female Ae. aegypti densities decreased by 44 %, 60 %, and 80 % in clusters with one, two, and three traps/house, respectively. The expected number of dengue-infected mosquitoes per thousand were 2.01, 1.70, 0.60, and 0.36 in clusters with zero, one, two, and three traps/house, respectively. Increases in dengue IgG antibody prevalence from 2022 to 2023 were noted only among residents aged 1-10 years, with rates of 25 %, 18 %, 6 %, and 5.9 % corresponding to the number of traps used. To reduce dengue incidence, local populations of Ae. aegypti should be kept below 4 females per AGO trap per week.

AB  - The constant evolution of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) constitutes a major threat to human health with limited treatment options. In our previous studies, we invented an innovative cycloberberine (CBBR) scaffold to battle MRSA and other Gram-positive strains. Herein, we report the synthesis and biological evaluations of forty-four CBBR esters derivatives, of which forty-two were new, against Gram-positive pathogens. Compound 5a demonstrated superior in vitro potency against MRSA and VISA strains, with MIC values of 0.06-0.125 μg/mL, outperforming the reference drug levofloxacin (MIC range: 0.125-32 μg/mL). Meanwhile, it reduced the MRSA burden in murine skin infection model and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, exemplified as interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, in MRSA-infected wounds. Further mechanism study revealed its unique ability to inhibit bacterial genomic DNA replication by targeting DNA polymerase IIIC, distinct from the clinical antibiotics. Therefore, we consider CBBR ester derivatives to be a promising class of anti-MRSA agents worthy of further investigation.

AB  - Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a serious infectious disease worldwide, characterized by high mortality and morbidity. Azole drugs are the most commonly used drugs for the treatment of invasive fungal infections. However, because azole drugs can easily interact with human CYPs metabolic enzymes, the risk of drug-to-drug interaction is high when multiple drugs are used together with azole drugs in clinic. As the problem of fungal drug resistance is becoming increasingly serious, there is an urgent need to develop new CYP51 inhibitors. The successful marketing of Oteseconazole has brought the development of azole drugs into a new era. Compound A33, previously discovered by our group, showed excellent antifungal activity against a variety of pathogenic and drug-resistant fungi. Nevertheless, owing to its structural characteristics, it showed poor selectivity for the human CYPs family and extremely poor metabolic stability. To address the above problem, inspired by the reduced CYP inhibition observed in Oteseconazole, we replaced its triazole group with tetrazole and attempted deuteration strategies and carbonyl introduction to block the metabolic site. This modification led to the synthesis of compounds V01-V24, in which V23 showed broad-spectrum activity and resistance characteristics, especially against Aspergillus fumigatum (MIC

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is perceived as a silent pandemic with dire predictions for humanity. S. aureus and its methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant variants have been identified as some of the leading pathogens for deaths associated with resistance. The quest to discover novel agents against these pathogens has proven difficult. Compounds with novel chemotype and/or novel mechanism of action have been put forth as one of the innovation criteria. In search for novel chemotypes with potential bioactivity, Pseudo-Natural product hypothesis relies on designing hitherto unknown scaffolds by combining natural product fragments in a biologically pre-validated and synthetically tractable ways. Herein, we report the discovery of a novel antibacterial chemotype, derived from indotropane pseudo natural products, with potent activity against both susceptible and resistant strains of S. aureus. The hit compound, 7af possesses potent bactericidal nature, shows synergy with FDA-approved Gentamicin and doesn't induce resistance up to the 28th passage. It eradicates pre-formed biofilm by up to 5% and displays good in vivo efficacy in murine skin infection model. Despite the presence of nitro-group, 7af does not act as substrate of nitro-reductase enzyme in both S.aureus and M. smegmatis, thereby, hinting towards a different mechanism of action.

AB  - The uncontrolled rise and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a critical and immediate threat to global health, responsible for millions of deaths annually, with current trends indicating that the global burden of disease is poised to increase dramatically in the coming decades. Meanwhile, the antibiotic pipeline is dominated by incremental variations on compounds already in clinical use. There is thus a pressing need to explore novel therapeutic strategies with lower likelihood of resistance development. One such promising target is FabV, an enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (ENR). These enzymes represent a crucial component of the universal bacterial fatty acid biosynthetic pathway (FasII), that is found across several critical Gram-negative bacteria. This includes P. aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen associated with hospital infections. This pathogen co-expresses FabV with its more common isozyme FabI, rendering it resistant to existing FabI inhibitors. This study aimed to investigate the rational, iterative design of P. aeruginosa FabV (paFabV) inhibitors. A total of 59 compounds, based on the previously established diaryl ether scaffold for ENR inhibition, were synthesized and screened in an NADH absorbance-based enzymatic assay. These efforts resulted in identifying para-benzenesulfonamides as privileged motifs and establishing the ideal length of the alkyl chain substituent to be five or six carbon atoms. Molecular modelling simulations indicate that the increase in potency is due to the sulfonamide group being able to engage in hydrogen bonding with Ser155, a highly conserved residue across FabV isoforms from various bacterial species. The findings reported herein provide a promising foundation for further exploration of the therapeutic potential of FabV inhibition.

AB  - In the 5 years since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the field of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has dramatically expanded with programs implemented across the globe to monitor for SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses of public health concern. However, the best way to use wastewater surveillance data and inform local communities of the utility of wastewater science remains limited and sporadically discussed. Specifically, there is vague guidance regarding interpreting varying levels of viral loads in wastewater for public health significance. While collaborative efforts are key to implementing these community-specific wastewater surveillance programs, effectively using the data for public health decision-making still needs significant refinement. Aligned with recent calls for advancing the science of wastewater surveillance, the experiences described in this article examine the critical need to advance other aspects of WBE programs, including communication, ethics, and decision-making.

AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is a significant pathogen responsible for severe foodborne illnesses, including hemolytic uremic syndrome. This review offers a detailed analysis of how Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) can assess and reduce the risks posed by STEC in a wide range of food products globally. Studies on STEC prevalence and risk in both animal-based and plant-based foods highlight QMRA's utility in understanding pathogen behavior, contamination sources, and key risk factors in different production and consumption settings. By synthesizing data on STEC contamination in foods like ground beef, dairy, and leafy greens, this review demonstrates the regional variations in contamination risks and evaluates the effectiveness of QMRA models. The article also highlights the role of emerging technologies, such as ultraviolet light (UV) treatment, high hydrostatic pressure (HHP), and neutral electrolyzed water, which have proven effective during food processing in reducing STEC contamination and improving food safety. The findings highlight the need for continued refinement of QMRA models to strengthen food safety measures and enhance risk management strategies.

AB  - Climate change amplifies cyanobacterial blooms, creating a feedback loop between warming and bloom intensity. This dynamic emphasizes the need to address greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during in-situ cyanobacterial control, minimizing algicides use and its long-term climatic impacts. However, research on the dose-response of algicides on GHG emissions is limited. This study investigated the dose-dependent effects of artemisinin sustained-release algicides (ASAs) on GHG emissions and microbial dynamics during cyanobacteria recovery prevention. Microcosm experiments revealed that ASAs dosage reshaped the carbonate system, lowering pH and increasing DOC and C/N ratio, promoting short-term CO₂ emissions. Microbial diversity decreased with higher ASAs dosage, and Proteobacteria replaced Cyanobacteria as the dominant group. The formate metabolic pathway, which produces CO₂, was strengthened, while CH₄ oxidation was weakened. The abundance of genera such as Curvibacter, Burkholderiales, and Acetobacterales increased, correlating with enhanced carbon and nitrogen metabolism, while CH₄-oxidizing genera like Methylobacterium and Methylorubrum showed reduced abundance, associated with weakened CH₄ metabolism. Co-occurrence networks emphasized that the ASAs gradient indirectly affected dominant microbes and carbon-nitrogen metabolism by altering water chemistry. ASAs exacerbated GHG emissions by coupling environmental changes with microbial metabolism. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for using lower ASAs dose during cyanobacteria recovery prevention and underscore the importance of considering biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem impacts in cyanobacterial control.

AB  - An outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A, subtype H5N1, first reported in U.S. dairy cattle in March 2024, raised concerns of an emerging food safety threat from the virus in the milk supply. To support potential regulatory responses, we conducted a rapid assessment of the predicted risk to U.S. consumers of cow's milk with two complementary and parallel approaches: a "bottom-up" quantitative risk assessment model that integrated data on virus levels in milk, milk consumption, and dose response; and a "top-down" epidemiological analysis that linked current novel flu illness detection to the consumption of raw and pasteurized milk. The dynamic use of the approaches accommodated rapidly evolving data in a range of risk scenarios. The risk assessment model identified pasteurization as a critical control for H5N1 in milk and highlighted the need for i) the targeted sampling of bulk tank raw milk in affected states pre-pasteurization, ii) raw milk herd surveillance and sampling, and iii) a better understanding of ingestion as a route of H5N1 infections for humans. This novel approach and the findings from this study promoted informed decision-making in an evolving outbreak investigation. This methodology can be leveraged in the conduct of future risk assessments to address emerging pathogen outbreaks that impact the food supply.

AB  - Research into alternative compounds for the treatment of bacterial infections has intensified in recent years due to the emergence of resistant bacterial strains and the obsolescence of traditional antibiotics. Polyoxometalates (POMs) are metal‑oxygen clusters of high-valent early transition metals that show promising biological activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria, with molybdenum-, tungsten-, and vanadium-containing POMs standing out. While the synthesis and physicochemical characterization of POMs has been studied and gradually understood in recent decades, the scientific community lacks more detailed information about their activity and biological action mechanism, demanding more scientific efforts for this purpose. This bibliometric review seeks to reduce part of this asymmetry by addressing the latest evidence on the antibacterial activity of POMs against different strains. To this end, scientific articles were searched in the SCOPUS and Web of Science databases between 1996 and 2023, using the descriptors "bacteria", "polyoxometalates", and "antibiotic activity", resulting in over 1200 direct and indirect correlations. By focusing the research on case studies, around 60 scientific reports were selected and used in this review. Although the antibacterial activity of POMs is not recent, there has been an increase in speculation about this characteristic over the last decade, especially identified in Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus strains. The different strategies studied to improve dose-response results, as well as the challenges and perspectives in this issue are also within the scope of this review, supporting further research in this area.

AB  - The growing emergence of pathogens resistant to the currently available antibacterial agents is an increasing and troublesome health problem worldwide. Modifying known active compounds has received wide attention and has become one of the hot spots in developing novel antibiotics. Herein we describe the synthesis of fifteen novel analogs of ciprofloxacin with a selenocyanate or selenoester functionality in the scaffold of this fluoroquinolone. Notably, these selenium (Se)-bearing molecules showcase an interesting antibacterial activity against eight different bacteria strains. Amidst them, CP7 had an important effect on the bacterial growth as observed in the growth kinetic studies carried out. Moreover, its efficacy to disrupt and prevent the formation of biofilms by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) surpassed the one obtained with the parent antibiotic. Additionally, this ciprofloxacin analog demonstrated to have a potent inhibitory activity towards the DNA gyrase from Escherichia coli (E. coli) both in silico and in vitro.

AB  - A common consequence of Parkinson's disease (PD) is constipation. Beyond its deleterious effect on the quality of life in affected persons, constipation is associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis and microbial-generated inflammatory metabolites, which may further disease progression. Management strategies are needed, and diet, specifically higher fiber dietary patterns or fiber supplements, may be recommended. However, therapeutic effectiveness and potential health benefits have been underexplored, and risks may be unappreciated. This perspective addresses whether high-fiber diets and fiber supplements to support laxation are efficacious, safe, and generally feasible for people with PD. Diverse sources of fiber from plant-based dietary patterns may be particularly critical for balancing microbiota and the microbial production of beneficial vs. inflammatory metabolites, although adherence to such dietary patterns may be challenging. Supplemental fiber may be needed to manage constipation symptoms. However, the potential safety issues related to fiber supplementation, such as appetite suppression, unintentional weight loss, and risk of malnutrition in the context of neurodegeneration, must also be considered. Slow colonic transit time and defecatory disorders of PD may be best managed with high intakes of bran or hull fibers resistant to microbial fermentation, which will significantly increase stool bulking. However, clinical trials are needed to confirm efficacy and dose-response.

AB  - To enhance control of human pathogenic microorganisms in plant production systems, an EU COST Action (HUPLANTcontrol CA16110) was initiated, bringing together microbiologists in food, environmental, and plant microbial ecology. This article summarizes the outcomes of multiple workshops and the four main lessons learned: (i) many terminologies need further explanation to facilitate multidisciplinary communication on the behavior of human pathogens from preharvest plant production to postharvest food storage, (ii) the complexity of bacterial taxonomy pushes microbial hazard identification for greater resolution of characterization (to subspecies, or even strain level) needing a multimethod approach, (iii) hazard characterization should consider a range of factors to evaluate the weight of evidence for adverse health effects in humans, including strain pathogenicity, host susceptibility, and the impact of the plant, food, or human gut microbiome, (iv) a wide diversity of microorganisms in varying numbers and behaviors coexist in the plant microbiome, including good (beneficial for plant or human health), bad (established human or plant pathogens), or ugly (causing spoilage or opportunistic disease). In conclusion, active listening in communication and a multiperspective approach are the foundation for every successful conversation when plant science meets food safety.

This study aimed to synthesize novel hydrazone derivatives and evaluate their antimicrobial potential. METHODS: Hydrazones were synthesized via condensation of 2-hydrazinobenzimidazole with various aldehydes or ketones using citric acid as an eco-friendly catalyst. The (E)-configuration of the products was confirmed through frontier molecular orbital (FMO) calculations. Antimicrobial activities were assessed against selected Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. Molecular docking studies were conducted on the most active compounds ( RESULTS: Compounds  DISCUSSION: The comparable binding patterns and energies of compounds

AB  - The hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsid protein forms a protective nucleocapsid essential for viral replication, establishing capsid assembly modulation as a promising therapeutic strategy. Based on previous mechanistic studies, we identified phthalazine derivatives as potent HBV capsid assembly modulators (CAMs), with Yhhu6517 exhibiting submicromolar antiviral activity in vitro. However, its clinical translation was hindered by poor oral pharmacokinetics (PK), due to rapid first-pass metabolism of oxidation-prone primary alcohol groups. Through metabolic stability-guided structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies involving systematic replacement of primary alcohols with non-primary alcohol-derived hydrophilic groups, we optimized the fragments to yield compound 2p. This optimized candidate 2p maintained a potent anti-HBV activity (IC

AB  - A new series of Benzimidazole pyridinecarbonitrile scaffolds 4a-r have been designed and synthesized through a regioselective Michael addition interaction between 2-acetyl N-propyne-benzimidazole (1) and ylidenemalononitrile (2), facilitated by a freshly prepared sodium methoxide solution. All synthesized derivatives were assessed for their antimicrobial potential on S. aureus (Gram-positive), P. aeruginosa (Gram-negative), as well as C.albicans (unicellular fungal). Derivatives 4a, 4c, 4f, 4l, 4m and 4q showed promising antimicrobial properties against all the tested MDR pathogens. In particular, compounds 4c, 4f, 4l, and 4m demonstrated brilliant inhibitory activity on C.albicans with MIC = 10 μg/mL each, a 4-fold increase compared to Amphotericin B (MIC = 40 μg/mL). While compound 4a presented MIC = 10 μg/mL compared with ciprofloxacin (MIC = 20 μg/mL) against MRSA, the MIC recorded by 4c and 4f against P. aeruginosa was 20 μg/mL, which equals that of ciprofloxacin. Bacterial lipid peroxidation (LPO) and antibiofilm activity and evaluation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by the most potent derivatives were evaluated, revealing that derivatives 4f and 4m demonstrated the best behavior among the tested compounds. Furthermore, molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations validated the stability of compound 4f within the catalytic binding pocket of the DNA gyrase receptor. The molecules were geometrically optimized using DFT with the B3LYP 6-21 basis set, and their electronic properties were analyzed. The study also encompassed ADME predictions and drug-likeness assessments for the new compounds.

AB  - This PRISMA review investigated the extent to which epidemiological evidence supports the use of faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) to manage microbial health risks in recreational waters without point sources of sewage. The quality of papers meeting the inclusion criteria was appraised using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) Risk of Bias tool and low-bias studies were synthesised. Studies consistently reported elevated illness risks (particularly gastrointestinal) among bathers compared with non-bathers. However, no FIOs or pathogens were associated consistently with any health outcomes. While enterococci most frequently correlated with a variety of illnesses, the relatively even split of positive and negative associations suggests an overall lack of association. Consequently, applying FIO guidelines derived from epidemiological studies with point sources of sewage could result in type I and type II errors. Overall, results suggest that the sources and drivers of health risks are site-specific. Tools including sanitary surveys, microbial source tracking, epidemiology and quantitative microbial risk assessment provide avenues for characterising site-specific health risks, for those who can afford them. Meanwhile, characterising the site-specific sources/drivers of contamination seems pragmatic as the limited evidence so far suggests that FIO monitoring may not be sufficient to protect health in these waters.

AB  - Cell lines and primary cultures are widely used to study host-pathogen interactions, reducing the need for challenge trials with live fish, which are costly and raise ethical concerns. We present Atlantic salmon scale explants (SE) as a promising model for bacterial challenges. Comparison with the body map (transcriptomes of seventeen cells and tissues) revealed strong immune activity in SE. SE ranked first in antiviral gene expression and second and third in antibacterial and inflammatory responses, respectively. Additionally, SE shows high expression of skin-specific genes encoding structural proteins of the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix. Contrast to the epidermis, dermis, and whole skin highlights immune genes, including markers of acute inflammation and stress. Exposure to pathogens (Moritella viscosa and Tenacibaculum finnmarkense) and commensal bacteria consistently upregulated a suite of immune genes in a dose response manner. This panel includes chemokines, cytokines, genes involved in eicosanoid metabolism, and both humoral and cellular effectors. The prevalence of genes related to signaling and communication suggests that salmon scales function as sentinels, mobilizing immune responses upon encountering bacteria. While common immune responses were evident across all trials, scales also revealed differences between bacterial species. Combining commensal bacteria with M. viscosa enhanced responses to pathogens, and differences were observed between M. viscosa and T. finnmarkense. The effects of commensal bacteria varied in magnitude. Exposed cells showed changes in morphology and increased iNOS expression. Future development of this model will focus on time-course experiments and expanding the analytical repertoire to include pathology detection methods.

AB  - The cell lysis effect of Meucin-18 enhances its antibacterial activity (MIC = 3 μM against S. aureus AB208193), but also leads to considerable toxicity, as nearly complete hemolysis is observed at 12.5 μM, thereby limiting its potential for further development and application. In this paper, we modified the structure of Meucin-18 in an attempt to obtain derived peptides with stronger antibacterial activity or less hemolytic toxicity. The results showed that the derived peptide CH-1, CH-1-1, CH-1-2, and CH-1-3 exhibited much more potent antibacterial activity and stronger biofilm inhibitory effect than Meucin-18. CH-1 significantly lysed bacterial cell membranes, leading to bacterial death, and exhibited lower hemolysis toxicity than Meucin-18. CH-1 exhibits good in vivo safety. At a dose of 500 mg/kg, it does not cause the death of galleria mellonella, and at 1000 mg/kg, the survival rate can still reach 66.6 %. Additionally, the in vivo therapeutic effects of CH-1 (15 mg/kg) in mice are comparable to those of VAN (15 mg/kg). CH-1 is a derived peptide obtained by replacing the fourth histidine of Meucin-18 with arginine, which has one more positive charge than Meucin-18. The additional positive charge further strengthened the electrostatic interaction of CH-1 with bacterial membrane. This may be the possible reason why CH-1 has excellent antibacterial effect. Overall, the design of the derived peptide CH-1 is successful and can be further evaluated for its druggability in future research.

AB  - Ensuring food safety is a shared priority for both the European Union (EU) and China, yet differences in regulatory frameworks, enforcement mechanisms, and risk assessment approaches present challenges for harmonization. The SAFFI project (2020-2024), which concluded recently, seeked to bridge these gaps by fostering collaboration in food safety management, with a specific focus on infant food safety. Bringing together partners from several EU member states and Chinese provinces, SAFFI aimed to improve hazard identification, risk ranking, detection methods, and mitigation strategies for both microbial and chemical contaminants in infant food supply chains. This article first provides a comparative analysis of EU and Chinese food safety regulations, highlighting key similarities and differences in legal structures, risk assessment procedures, and enforcement strategies. Infant food safety standards are particularly strict in both regions, yet inconsistencies in testing methods, contaminant limits, and monitoring approaches necessitate greater alignment. The second part of the article details the scientific advances achieved through SAFFI to support regulatory convergence. These include structured databases and decision-support tools for hazard identification and prioritization, improved processing and preservation techniques for contaminant control, and cutting-edge analytical methods for detecting and monitoring known and emerging chemical and microbial hazards. The project also examined the role of consumer practices in mitigating risks and explored pathways for integrating rapid detection technologies into food safety systems. Overall, the outcomes of SAFFI contribute to enhanced consumer protection, the promotion of safe international trade, and the development of more coherent, science-based food safety policies through sustained EU-China cooperation.

AB  - Regulatory frameworks for potable reuse often include stringent log reduction value (LRV) targets for viruses and protozoa. To reliably protect public health while also considering the sustainability of advanced water treatment, it is critically important to accurately and rapidly assess pathogen removal and avoid under-crediting of any unit process in a potable reuse treatment train. This study systematically evaluates secondary biological wastewater treatment across solids retention times (SRTs) ranging from 2 to 20 days and uses culture and molecular methods to characterize attenuation of 12 viruses, including fecal indicators, surrogate bacteriophages, and enteric pathogens. This study also proposes a mechanistic model for physical removal based on a solids partitioning/adsorption framework incorporating mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentrations.

AB  - The growing occurrence of antimicrobial resistance has called for an urgent need to develop new sources of antimicrobial agents against multidrug-resistant strains. The trillions of microbes living in the gut become gradually a promising source of novel antimicrobial agents. In this study, we isolated a candidate strain with good antibacterial activity identified as Bacillus haynesii strain B1 from the sheep intestine and obtained a novel antimicrobial peptide through B. haynesii strain B1 genome mining, denoted as CR24. The CR24 showed an excellent and broad-spectrum antibacterial ability, no significant cytotoxicity, and very low levels of hemolytic activity. The mode of antibacterial action suggested that CR24 had bactericidal activity and could destroy cell membrane integrity, increase cell membrane permeability, and eventually lead to cell death. Moreover, we also demonstrated that APH (3')-IIIa phosphotransferase might provide a potential intracellular target for CR24 against neomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The anti-S. aureus skin wound infection revealed that CR24 exhibited good antibacterial properties in vivo and could accelerate wound healing and skin regeneration. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate CR24 is a promising and attractive candidate for further antimicrobial drug development and underscore the importance of developing new antimicrobial drugs from gut commensals.

AB  - This study investigated faecal microbial composition and blood metabolome profile of piglets fed different levels of supplementary zinc oxide (ZnO) after weaning. A dose-response study was conducted with four experimental diets containing 153 (D153), 1022 (D1022), 1601 (D1601), and 2407 (D2407) ppm zinc (Zn) in the feed. At the end of the trial, blood and faeces samples were obtained for analyses. Multivariate analysis of the blood metabolomics dataset and Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) of faecal microbiota data showed that pigs receiving D2407 had a different metabolic and microbial profile to the other groups, whereas no differences were observed in pigs fed with D153, D1022, and D1601. The highest dietary Zn inclusion was associated with significant increase in the abundance of Clostridium sensu stricto, Terrisporobacter, Dorea, and Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group and a decrease in relative abundances of Methanobrevibacter, Treponema, Megasphaera, and UCG 002 genera. Pearson's correlation analysis showed positive correlations between the abundance of Christensenellaceae R7-group with amino acids metabolism and production of microbial metabolites. The results suggest that only 2407 ppm Zn altered gut microbiota and modulated blood metabolic profile, which may impact the health status of piglets through specific microbial metabolites.

AB  - The pursuit of multifunctional therapeutic agents remains crucial in combating oxidative stress and microbial resistance. In this study, we synthesized and characterized a diverse series of novel isatin-based derivatives (12a-z), exploring their antioxidant and antimicrobial potential. Notably, compound 12c demonstrated remarkable antioxidant efficacy among all isatin-based derivatives, with an IC₅₀ value of 9.79 ± 0.168 µg/mL in the DPPH radical scavenging assay, positioning it as a potent radical scavenger comparable to the standard (ascorbic acid). Furthermore, antimicrobial screening identified compounds 12a and 12b as standout candidates, showcasing strong antibacterial and antifungal properties through disc-diffusion and broth dilution methods. These promising bioactivities underscore the potential of 12a, 12b and 12c as therapeutic agents, meriting further investigation for their application in oxidative stress-related conditions and infectious disease management. This study lays the groundwork for future development of isatin derivatives as pharmacologically relevant molecules in both antioxidant and antimicrobial domains.

AB  - Structural derivatization of known leads using the scaffold hopping strategy is a classic approach in pesticide discovery. However, the modificatory universality of lead skeletons profoundly influences the feasibility of this protocol. We herein report development of disulfaneyl oxadiazole bactericides involving β-carboline moieties. Derivative B18 is filtered out to exhibit excellent in vitro antibacterial properties with half-maximal effective concentrations of 0.47 mg/L, 1.72 mg/L, and 5.97 mg/L against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola, and Xanthomonas citri pv. citri, respectively. The observed values fall short in comparison to the positive controls thiodiazole copper (TC) and allicin (AC). Moreover, in vivo pot studies reveal that B18 demonstrates enhanced curative (49.12 %) and protective (49.41 %) efficacy in comparison to the control groups TC and AC. Investigation regarding the mechanism of action indicates that B18 functions through a dual antibacterial approach. It not only interferes with the metabolic pathways of starch and sucrose in bacteria, and boosts the activity of rice defense enzymes while upregulating the expression of pyruvate kinase in the glycolytic pathway, thereby enhancing the plant resistance to bacterial pests.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Standard dosing regimens of meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam frequently fail to achieve targeted plasma concentrations in critically ill patients. Extended or continuous regimens are often used to improve target attainment. Although prompt antibiotic initiation is a major determinant of survival, few studies have reported systemic concentrations early after treatment initiation. No prior study has reported concentrations immediately after the loading dose and first extended infusion. This study aimed to evaluate plasma target attainment during the first dosing interval with an extended infusion regimen in a general intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Adult ICU patients were prospectively included in conjunction with the first administration of meropenem or piperacillin-tazobactam. Treatment was initiated with a 0.5 h loading dose immediately followed by a 3 h extended infusion; typically 4 + 4 g piperacillin or 1(- 2)g + 1(- 2)g meropenem, in line with the local ICU protocol. Patients requiring renal replacement therapy were excluded. Plasma concentrations were measured post-loading dose (C RESULTS: We included 65 meropenem and 142 piperacillin measurements from 22 and 48 patients, respectively. Many patients (45% meropenem, 38% piperacillin) failed to reach 100% fT > MIC with the standard regimens used. Target non-attainment was associated with high estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) and suspected augmented renal clearance (ARC). All meropenem patients that failed to reach target had eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m CONCLUSIONS: Despite aggressive dosing, plasma concentrations often fail to reach 100% fT > MIC during the first dosing interval. Alternative regimens and early plasma concentration measurements followed by adaptive dose adjustments should be considered to improve target attainment.

AB  - This experiment investigated the effects of fermentation on the chemical composition of dried brewer's grain (DBG) and its inclusion in broiler diets on performance, carcass traits, intestinal histology, and blood proteins. The DBG was fermented for 21 days using Bacillus subtilis and Aspergillus oryzae. A total of 360 male broilers (Ross 308) were fed with 10 % or 20 % DBG or fermented DBG (FDBG) for 42 days. Results revealed that fermentation could reduce crude fiber, pH, nitrogen-free extract, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and total bacterial count whereas it increased Lactobacillus count as well as fat, ash, calcium, and phosphorus contents (P<0.01). Broilers fed 10 % FDBG exhibited a similar performance to the control group. Serum levels of total protein and globulin were significantly higher in broilers that received 10 % FDBG compared to the control (P<0.01). However, feeding broilers with 20 % DBG or 20 % FDBG reduced weight gain and worsened the feed conversion ratio (P < 0.001). Moreover, broilers that received 20 % DBG had a shorter ileal villus height compared to the control group (P=0.034). These findings suggest that microbial fermentation could improve the nutritional quality of DBG, and the fermented product (FDBG) could be included in broiler diets up to 10 % without impacting performance.

AB  - The prevalence of bacterial resistance, driven by extensive antibiotic overuse, significantly threatens patient safety. Consequently, it is urgent and helpful for the clinician to develop new antibacterial therapy techniques. In this study, we designed a novel photodynamic antibacterial therapeutic strategy by functionalizing D-alanine on Iridium(III) complexes. The synergistic D-alanine metabolic labeling function and two-photon photodynamic eradication capacity of Ir(III) complexes enable bacterial imaging and elimination of bacterial pathogens within host cells. These two-photon photoantibiotics effectively inhibit bacterial biofilm formation and efficiently eliminate intracellular bacterial infections in macrophages, enabling real-time dynamic monitoring of antimicrobial efficacy. Furthermore, both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated superior antibacterial performance compared to conventional antibiotics alone.

AB  - Despite efforts to discover effective treatments to eradicate tuberculosis (TB), it remains a global threat. The increase in drug-resistant bacterial species has made the discovery of new drugs highly coveted. The utilisation of previous efficacious structures is one approach that can be employed to developing novel series of compounds to combat this ever-growing problem. This study sought to re-examine two such compounds, isoxyl (ISO) and SQ109, previously shown to be efficacious in TB treatment. SQ109-ISO hybrid compounds were shown to have demonstrable activity against both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant

AB  - Outbreaks of Escherichia coli O157:H7 (ECO157) in romaine lettuce remain an ongoing public health concern. Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) models are key tools for identifying control measures to mitigate foodborne diseases. Here, we introduce a comprehensive QMRA framework along the farm-to-fork fresh-cut romaine lettuce chain, including a novel preharvest difference equation model, to predict annual ECO157 illness cases in the United States and evaluate control strategies. We demonstrated the importance of managing irrigation-related contamination at preharvest to control illness cases. Wildlife intrusions pose lower health risk, followed by runoffs and biological soil amendments of animal origin. When preharvest contamination persists and combines with time-temperature abuses at postharvest, the predicted ECO157 illness cases rise considerably. We showed a broad range of interventions targeting both preharvest and postharvest stages can effectively improve the microbial safety of fresh-cut romaine. The comprehensive practices and interventions explored in this study will aid decision-makers in establishing/enhancing food safety best management practices.

AB  - Disease risk management is essential for conservation translocations to prevent inadvertent pathogen introduction affecting human, animal and ecosystem health. Wildlife Disease Risk Analysis (DRA) is a recognized framework for addressing health hazards in translocations. However, DRA is not mandatory nor voluntarily applied in Argentina, despite increasing wildlife translocations. To test and adapt DRA to the local context, we performed a simplified DRA for the hypothetical translocation of marsh deer (Blastocerus dichotomus) between two protected areas, Iberá and El Impenetrable National Parks. A multidisciplinary team applied the main phases of DRA, problem description, hazard identification, risk assessment and mitigation, to this scenario. Out of 61 potential hazards identified, including pathogens and management issues, 14 priority hazards were highlighted using a paired risk prioritization tool. Of these, 66% have zoonotic potential. Presence of Ehrlichia chaffeensis at the source (Iberá) but not the destination park signalled unacceptable risk under a One Health perspective. All other hazards, including pathogens, stress and seasonal factors, were considered manageable through strategic planning and mitigation actions. This study represents the first application of DRA to conservation translocations in Argentina, in a context of data and resource limitations. Strengthening baseline information and stakeholder engagement would enhance its utility. DRA findings should inform broader ecological evaluations to assess feasibility and relevance of translocations. We advocate for the integration of DRA into conservation planning in Argentina and South America, even under suboptimal conditions.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a significant global concern, driven by the overuse of antibiotics. One of the principal mechanisms contributing to AMR is the activity of microbial efflux pumps (EPs), which expel diverse antibiotics out of bacterial cells, thereby rendering them ineffective. Our research aimed to expand the range of molecular classes that inhibit the Staphylococcus aureus EP NorA. In this study, starting from the hit compound pyrazolo[4,3-c][1,2]benzothiazine 5,5-dioxide 1, previously reported as a NorA efflux pump inhibitor (EPI), we undertook medicinal chemistry efforts, which involved the iterative combination of the design and synthesis of new analogues with data obtained through ethidium bromide efflux inhibition assays. Subsequent synergistic assays with ciprofloxacin (CPX) against the resistant strain SA-1199B led to the identification of three potent compounds (3, 10, and 19). The evaluation of these compounds in combination with CPX against NorA-overexpressing and NorA-knockout strains (SA-K2378 and SA-K1902, respectively) confirmed that the observed synergy with CPX is dependent on the presence of NorA. Additionally, the combination of NorA EPIs with CPX reduced biofilm production in NorA-overexpressing strains. These findings enhance our understanding of the structure-activity relationship of pyrazolobenzothiazine derivatives and support the use of EtBr efflux assays for rapid NorA inhibitors' identification.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the most common and widely distributed pathogenic bacterium. The problem of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) caused by the widespread use of antibiotics is particularly severe. In addition, S. aureus can resist antibiotics by forming biofilms, making clinical treatment difficult. A series of antimicrobial quinolone-based quaternary ammonium compounds were designed and synthesized. Among them, the optimal compound 3e showed the strongest activity against S. aureus, and it had relatively low hemolytic toxicity and cytotoxicity. Compound 3e has excellent bactericidal performance, capable of quickly and thoroughly sterilizing. In continuous sub-lethal concentration bacterial passage culture, no bacterial resistance tendency caused by 3e was found. Moreover, 3e can exert a significant level of activity in blood components and still has a period of suppression on bacteria after the drug is removed. Encouragingly, 3e has a certain bactericidal potential against bacteria with high concentration and high tolerance. It has shown strong bactericidal effects when fighting against persister bacteria and biofilms in vitro. Mechanism research indicates that 3e exerts its antimicrobial action through related membrane activity and is related to membrane components phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL). In addition, 3e can also bind to bacterial DNA.

AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is an important Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen that uses quorum sensing to regulate its virulence and biofilm development, which contributes to its pathogenicity and drug resistance. As a result, focusing on the virulence and pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa through quorum sensing (QS) is considered a possible target for anti-infective therapy. In this work, we discovered new quorum-sensing inhibitors derived from the structural modification of the dithiocarbamate-based l-homoserine lactone derivatives library and the target compound (10p) demonstrated significant inhibitory activity against PAO1 biofilm (inhibition rate: 86.76 %), pyocyanin (68.05 %), rhamnolipid (34.56 %), LasA protease (61.01 %) and a low inhibitory on elastase production (6.59 %) at 60 μM. Moreover, compound 10p effectively attenuated P. aeruginosa motility, such as swimming (42.85 %) and swarming (72 %), and demonstrated no toxicity in vitro. The result indicates that compound 10p may serve as a promising new antibacterial synergist option for treating P. aeruginosa infections.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different bile acid levels in the diet on the growth performance, hepatic lipid metabolism, antioxidant capacity, and cecal microbiota of Danzhou chickens. 480 one-day-old male Danzhou chickens were randomly divided into four treatments and fed diets supplemented with 0, 200, 400, or 800 mg/kg bile acids. The trial lasted for 35 days. The results indicated that supplementing the diet with 400 mg/kg bile acids significantly increased average daily weight gain and reduced the feed conversion ratio (P < 0.05). Bile acid supplementation modulated serum lipid profiles, with 800 mg/kg increasing total bile acid levels, while 400 mg/kg reduced triglyceride and total cholesterol concentrations (P < 0.05). In the liver, 400 mg/kg bile acids increased total bile acid content, reduced triglycerides and total cholesterol accumulation, upregulated phospholipase C delta 1, acyl-CoA oxidase 1, and apolipoprotein A1 expression, and enhanced hepatic lipase and lipoprotein lipase activities (P < 0.05), indicating alleviated lipid deposition. All bile acids treatments improved antioxidant capacity by elevating total antioxidant capacity, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase levels (P < 0.05) while reducing malondialdehyde (P < 0.05) in serum and liver, with optimal effects at 400 mg/kg. Bile acid supplementation increased levels of immunoglobulins (IgA and IgG) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (P < 0.05), while reducing levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β (P < 0.05). Morphological analysis of the intestine revealed that 400 mg/kg of bile acids significantly enhanced villus height and the villus height-to-crypt depth ratio (P < 0.05) in both the duodenum and ileum. Cecal microbiota analysis revealed that supplementation with 400 mg/kg bile acids increased microbial diversity and enriched Christensenellaceae_R-7_group and Weissella, whereas Barnesiellaceae_unclassified, Campylobacter, and Lactobacillus were predominant in the CON. In conclusion, the results suggest that dietary supplementation with 400 mg/kg of bile acids enhances antioxidant capacity and immune function in Danzhou chickens, potentially improving serum and hepatic lipid metabolism by modulating the cecal microbiota, thereby promoting growth performance.

AB  - Widespread soil heavy metal (HM) pollution has caused great concerns worldwide. A refined and cost-effective ecological risk assessment (ERA) is critical for managing these risks. Herein, we propose a novel tiered ERA framework to evaluate indigenous pollution-effect associations in contaminated soils. This framework progressively applies source apportionment, spatial regression, deterministic and probabilistic risk characterization, ecological surveys of soil phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), and successive multivariable statistics to provide comprehensive ERA evidence, as demonstrated in an ecologically fragile mining area. The risk screening phase identified Zn, Pb, Cd, Cu, and Hg as priority contaminants, and mining activities contributed 86.5 % (Zn), 87.2 % (Pb), 83.3 % (Cd), 64.6 % (Cu), and 52.3 % (Hg) of the total soil concentrations in the study area determined by the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model. The risk quotient of ecological criteria tailored to different land uses exhibited ecologically relevant risk grading. The risk quantification phase determined the overall risk probabilities to be 53.98 %, 11.12 %, 9.69 %, 5.03 % and 1.34 % for Zn, Pb, Cu, Cd and Hg, respectively, and provided adaptive HM priority lists with different risk grades. The risk causeeffect attribution phase confirmed that HMs significantly reduced soil fungal PLFA abundance and indirectly altered the PLFA structure by decreasing the soil pH. The proposed framework offers a cost-effective, refined and feasible technical support for ecological risk management in contaminated areas.

AB  - Carprofen, a veterinary non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, has demonstrated bactericidal activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the closely related model organism M. bovis BCG. Herein, we present the SAR-driven optimisation of three series of carbazole-based carprofen analogues for increased antimycobacterial potency and selectivity over the human monocyte-derived THP-1 cell line. An efficient synthetic route was employed to assemble a range of carprofen analogues which were then evaluated in whole-cell phenotypic assays to establish their activity against well-studied model organisms for M. tuberculosis. The most promising compound was further profiled against M. tuberculosis H37Rv, confirming the identification of a potent antitubercular carbazole with significantly enhanced therapeutic potential.

AB  - Smp43 is a natural antimicrobial peptide derived from scorpion venom containing 43 amino acids, which inhibits the proliferation of various cancer cells, providing a new surrogate for antitumor drug discovery. However, Smp43 is large (Mw: 4653 Da) and unstable as a linear peptide. We truncated Smp43 to identify the key fragment and found that Smp(1-14) displayed significant antitumor activity. Subsequent optimization of Smp(1-14) led to a series of stapled peptides, among which SSmp6 demonstrated enhanced antitumor activity, stability, and membrane permeability compared to the linear peptides. Moreover, SSmp6 could decrease the phosphorylation of AKT, damage cancer cell membranes, and induce cell apoptosis. The results highlight the potential of SSmp6 as a lead stapled peptide for developing novel antitumor therapies. The study introduces a concept for using antimicrobial peptides to develop anticancer drugs.

AB  - Carbapenem resistance is an ongoing clinical problem, largely driven by production of evolved serine β-lactamases (SBLs) and metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs). We here report a series of new 3-methacrylic acid-substituted benzoxaboroles as dual MBL/SBL inhibitors. Structure-activity relationship studies showed that the new compounds manifested nanomolar inhibition to the SBLs KPC-2 and OXA-48, and single-digit micromolar inhibition to the MBLs VIM-2, NDM-1, and NDM-5. Co-crystallographic analyses revealed their binding modes with VIM-2 and OXA-48, which are similar as those of taniborbactam and xeruborbactam. Bacterial assays demonstrated that compound 10 can potentiate meropenem against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative strains. This work provides new lead compounds and structural basis for developing new drug candidates against MBL/SBL-mediated carbapenem resistance.

AB  - Nipah virus, a zoonotic pathogen, can cause debilitating disease and death in humans. Currently, countermeasures are limited, with several in various stages of testing but none yet FDA-approved for human use. Evaluation of countermeasure candidates requires safety testing in humans, as well as efficacy testing against lethal challenge in animal models. Herein, we describe the characterization and comparison of the intraperitoneal and intranasal Syrian golden hamster models for Nipah virus strains Malaysia and Bangladesh. Overall, the intraperitoneal route of exposure resulted in a more consistent lethal outcome, regardless of virus strain. Therefore, the IP model was subsequently used to evaluate the use of Favipiravir as a potential positive control for future studies investigating NiV countermeasures. In contrast to prior reported results regarding Favipiravir in Nipah virus-infected hamsters, Favipiravir was only fifty percent effective at preventing death following lethal challenge, regardless of Nipah virus strain. The data suggest that Favipiravir is only partially protective against Nipah virus in hamsters, and, thus, would likely not be an ideal candidate as a positive control in future efficacy studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) is a promising tool used to ensure therapeutic antimicrobial concentrations. Model selection and sampling strategy might lead to different pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter estimates. Herein, we assess the predictive performance for cefepime PK in two models implemented within the InsightRX software using differing sampling approaches. METHODS: Historic cefepime PK data and individual Bayesian estimates in predominantly critically ill patients, some of whom had extracorporeal support, served as the reference standard. Two population PK models (A; B) were evaluated using four sampling scenarios: (i) trough only, (ii) midpoint only, (iii) trough + midpoint, and (iv) peak + midpoint + trough. The median prediction error (MPE) and median absolute prediction error (MAPE) were calculated for clearance (CL) and volume of central compartment (V RESULTS: MAPE and MPE for CL and V CONCLUSIONS: These two population PK models and all sampling scenarios demonstrated acceptable prediction of cefepime PK parameters and pharmacodynamic exposures; therefore, they demonstrated suitability for utilizing MIPD for cefepime therapeutic drug monitoring.

AB  - Aiming at developing a new class of quaternary pyridinium salts, the lead compound 1, characterized by a pyridine-3-yl chalcone framework, was rationally modified by inserting alkyl functions varying from 6 to 18 carbon units. Among the set, some valuable lead compounds were identified. Derivatives 4-6 were primarily active against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans, respectively (MIC = 1.56 and 3.125 μM). In comparison, analogs 4 and 5 showed significant activities against Escherichia coli (MIC = 6.25 μM). Interestingly, the antimicrobial property of compounds 4-6, as well as their antibiofilm activity, occurred at lower concentrations than their cyto- and erythrocyte toxicities, thus ensuring a favorable safety profile. Structure-activity relationship analysis highlighted the critical role of the alkyl tail length in the antimicrobial activity, and optimal results were observed for moieties ranging from 10 to 14 carbon units. Molecular dynamics studies performed on 2 and 5 by modeling them on Gram-positive and Gram-negative membranes showed that the derivatives, upon diffusing across periodic boundary conditions, were able to intercalate into the microbial membranes. The difference in diffusion rates provides useful information to support the diverse antimicrobial potencies of the newly designed quaternary pyridinium salt.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) has ranked in the top three pathogens responsible for bacteria-related mortal infections. The emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) K. pneumoniae strains highlights an urgent need for novel antimicrobial agents. In this study, a series of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) were screened based on gene annotation and sequence profiling via high-quality whole genome maps of sea snakes Hydrophis curtus and Hydrophis cyanocinctus. The most potent Hydrostatin-AMP3 showed efficient antimicrobial capacity against a panel of pathogenic bacteria, particularly MDR K. pneumoniae strains. Moreover, Hydrostatin-AMP3 exhibited remarkable efficacy in infection models of MDR K. pneumoniae, while demonstrating favourable profiles in safety and resistance development both in vitro and in vivo studies. Mechanistically, Hydrostatin-AMP3 exerted a bactericidal effect through a unique dual-mechanism: bacterial membrane disruption and DNA-targeting. Overall, this study presented Hydrostatin-AMP3 as the potential antimicrobial candidate for the treatment of MDR K. pneumoniae infection.

AB  - Canarina eminii is a medicinal plant traditionally used to treat various ailments. Chemical investigation of the DCM/MeOH (1:1) roots extract of Canarina eminii afforded three anthraquinone compounds (1-3) that were previously unreported from this species. The structures of the isolated compounds 1-3 were elucidated using HR- ESI-MS, 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic analysis, and comparison with literature data. The DCM/MeOH (1:1) extract showed a maximal inhibitory zone of 18.40 ± 0.24 mm in diameter against S. aureus, which is promising in comparison to the standard, gentamicin (20.03 ± 0.01 mm). Among isolated compounds, the largest mean inhibition zone of 13.50 ± 0.03 mm was measured for compound 2 against S. aureus, comparable to the standard drug gentamicin (20.03 ± 0.01 mm). Compounds 1-3 displayed binding affinity with minimum binding energies ranging from -8.0 to -9.2 kcal/mol, -8.2 to -8.6 kcal/mol, and - 9.2 to -9.4 kcal/mol against Pseudomonas quinolone signal A, E. coli DNAgyrase B, and S. aureus pyruvate kinase, respectively, that showed greater binding affinity compared to the standard drug gentamicin. The Insilco drug likeness of compounds 1-3 showed projected toxicity class 5, indicating that they had no effect on organic toxicity. Compounds 1 and 3 predicted immunotoxicity and mutagenicity while, compound 2 is active only in mutagenicity. Overall, the in vitro antibacterial activity of the extract and compounds, molecular docking analysis results of the isolated compounds suggest DCM/MeOH crude extract and compound 2 are promising antibacterial agents, which corroborates with the traditional uses of the roots of C. eminii.

AB  - Citric acid, a common food ingredient, can induce cellular stress in foodborne pathogens, potentially affecting their viability and recovery. This study evaluated the physiological responses of Vibrio alginolyticus and Vibrio cholerae cells in logarithmic and stationary growth phases after exposure to citric acid at pH 4.5, 5.0, and 5.5 for 60, 120, and 180 min. After exposure, viability, membrane damage, efflux pump activity, and recovery were evaluated. Culture media type and growth phase had no significant effect on cell viability (p > 0.05). V. cholerae strains were more sensitive to citric acid than V. alginolyticus strains, with a slight reduction (0.5 log CFU/mL) after 180 min of citric acid exposure (p < 0.05). Membrane damage was greater in stationary-phase cells than in logarithmic-phase cells after 60 min, whereas efflux pump activity increased over time and was independent of the growth phase (p < 0.05). Regardless of pH, cells exposed to citric acid for 60 min had longer detection times (7.92 ± 0.7 h) compared to those exposed for 180 min (6.68 ± 1.45 h), and cells grew faster at high pH values and at lower exposure time (p < 0.05). Overall, citric acid induced mild sublethal damage in both V. alginolyticus and V. cholerae, with cell recovery primarily attributed to efflux pump activity. These results provide valuable insights into the risk associated with Vibrio cells under mild citric acid stress, a condition similar to that occurring during the preparation of raw fish dishes marinated in lemon juice.

AB  - The effects of starch on fish are species-dependent. The present study aimed to explore effects of dietary maize starch on growth, hepatopancreas health, and intestinal microbiota in juvenile Asian red-tailed catfish, Hemibagrus wyckioides. A total of 450 catfish with an average initial weight of approximately 23.97 ± 0.04 g were randomly assigned to five dietary treatments named as CK (0 %), C8 (8 %), C16 (16 %), C24 (24 %), and C32 (32 %), containing corresponding levels of maize starch. Weight gain, serum acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase activities, as well as the levels of complement components 3, components 4, and immunoglobulin M, increased linearly with rising dietary starch levels (P < 0.05), reaching the highest values in the C32 group. A linear increase in hepatosomatic index was observed with increasing dietary starch levels (P < 0.05). Hepatocellular vacuolation and elevated lipid droplet accumulation were evident in the C32 group. Serum concentrations of triglycerides, cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase were significantly elevated in the C24 and C32 compared to CK and C8 groups, and exhibited a positive linear relationship with dietary starch levels (P < 0.05). Compared with the CK group, dietary starch supplementation in the C16 and C32 groups significantly altered gut microbial composition. The C16 and C32 diets increased the relative abundances of Cetobacterium and Lactococcus, shifted microbial metabolism toward carbohydrate and nucleotide pathways, and reduced microbial diversity and network complexity, while enhancing competitive interactions within the community. In contrast, The CK diet favored amino acid and nitrogen metabolism. Collectively, a 32 % starch level supported optimal growth and improved immune responses in H. wyckioides, the risk of hepatic lipid accumulation highlights the need for longer-term studies to assess potential health implications.

AB  - As the population of persons experiencing homelessness (PEHs) continues to grow in urban areas, including Las Vegas in Southern Nevada, it becomes increasingly important to quantify and mitigate health risks encountered by this vulnerable population. This study examines exposure risks from Campylobacter, a leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis, among unsheltered PEHs who utilize untreated water from Las Vegas' flood control tunnels and washes for personal hygiene and cleaning. Utilizing quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA), we evaluated three exposure scenarios: direct bathing, toothbrushing, and hand-to-mouth contact following hand submersion. The median probability of illness for a single toothbrushing (5 %) or bathing event (5 %) exceeded the adopted risk threshold of 3.2 %, with estimated median annual risks reaching 36 % under monthly exposure frequencies. High concentrations of Campylobacter in these urban waterways underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions, including improved access to clean water and sanitation facilities, to mitigate the health risks faced by PEHs. This study provides a step forward in understanding and addressing the risks of interacting with water in urban waterways, including flood control infrastructure.

The NS5 protein of the ZIKV and DENV-2 inhibits the IFN-Ⅰ antiviral response by degrading STAT2, thereby evading the host's immune defense. Therefore, the development of novel agents capable of inhibiting STAT2 degradation via targeted modulation constitutes a pivotal therapeutic strategy for controlling viral infections.

AB  - Foodborne transmission appears to be a significant route for human hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in Europe. We have developed a quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) for HEV infection due to consumption of three selected pork products (liver pâté, minced meat, and sliced liver), which models the steps from farm to human consumption in high detail, including within-farm transmission dynamics and microbiological processes such as cross contamination and thermal inactivation. Our model is unique in that it considers prevalence and viral load of two microbiological variables, HEV RNA and infectious HEV, expressing the latter in terms of the former through so-called "adjustment factors" where data are lacking. When the QMRA was parameterized for France and using infectious HEV, we found that sliced liver posed by far the highest risk of infection, with mean probability per portion

AB  - BACKGROUND: In adult patients with sepsis or septic shock admitted to the emergency department, a single intravenous 15 mg/kg amikacin dose provides inadequate pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic target attainment at the locally reported minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2 mg/L and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing clinical breakpoint for Enterobacterales of 8 mg/L. OBJECTIVES: To provide an amikacin dosing strategy with a clinically acceptable probability of target attainment (PTA) for all patients. METHODS: Stochastic simulations were performed using a two-compartment population pharmacokinetics model of amikacin (NONMEM 7.5). PTA was evaluated for various dosing strategies across a range of virtual patients' body weight, body mass index, serum total protein, serum sodium, fluid balance, and estimated glomerular filtration rate according to the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation (eGFR CKD-EPI ), at the locally reported MIC of 2 mg/L and the clinical breakpoint of 8 mg/L. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic targets were a 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 24h )/MIC of ≥80 and a 24-hour postdose concentration (C 24h ) of < 3 mg/L for efficacy and safety, respectively. RESULTS: The PTA for the clinical breakpoint of 8 mg/L was <90% with standard 15 mg/kg dosing, across all patient characteristics. A flat 1500-mg dose achieved ≥90% PTA for the entire population at a MIC of 2 mg/L. However, at the clinical breakpoint of 8 mg/L, a flat 3500-mg dose provided ≥90% PTA only when the eGFR CKD-EPI was <96 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . The C 24h was similar for 1500 mg and 15 mg/kg dosing, whereas 3500 mg resulted in a higher C 24h . CONCLUSIONS: A flat dose is recommended over weight-based dosing. However, selecting a 1500-mg or 3500-mg dose may compromise either efficacy (MIC 2 mg/L) or safety (clinical breakpoint 8 mg/L), posing a dilemma. Clinical validation is warranted.

AB  - Cationic biocides, particularly quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), play a vital role in controlling microbial infections across various industries, healthcare facilities and households. As their widespread use increased drastically in the last few years due to COVID-19, there is growing concern about the development of resistance among microorganisms exposed to cationic biocides. It is crucial to recognize this threat in advance and respond by modifying and replacing the old generation of commercial biocides. Reported here is the pyridinium-based bis-QACs tuning via combination of two simple synthesis approaches to achieve novel biocide's architectures with mixed linkers. The obtained compounds were subjected to a broad bioactivity assay against a panel of 26 microbial pathogens, including multi-resistant bacterial ESKAPEE strains, fungi and biofilms. Novel hit-compounds showed improved antibacterial and antibiofilm action, rapid bacterial eradication within 15-30 min of exposure and 4.5-fold lower hemotoxicity, as well as lower potential for the development of bacterial resistance compared to commercial lead antiseptic octenidine. Highlighted findings and insights will serve as a good basis for further studies of bis-QACs as highly effective biocides.

AB  - The ever-growing field of nanotechnology requires optimized green manufacturing of gold nanoparticles. The current study focuses to optimize the green synthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using cranberry fruit extract, which has a rich phytochemical content and can operate as a reducing agent. The UV-Vis spectrum indicated the absorption at 530-550nm, which is characteristic of gold nanoparticles in the bottom-up approach. The IR spectra provided valuable information about the phytochemicals present in the plant extract. The major peaks of AuNPs in XRD and SEM, TEM images affirmed the synthesized nanoparticles are spherical in shape. The thermal stability of the nanoparticles was exemplified using TG-DTA analysis. Further, the synthesized particles were employed to study in-vitro cytotoxicity activity against MCF-7 breast cancerous cells and at its highest concentration (200 mL), the AuNPs showed highest cytotoxicity activity of 90.43 % against MCF-7 cell lines. The Anti-bacterial activity of the synthesized nanoparticles was observed on both gram positive and gram negative pathogens where the gram-negative pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed highest zone of inhibition (21 mm and 23 mm), while gram positive pathogens such as Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus faecalis showed less zone of inhibition (17 mm and 15 mm). Additionally, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was utilized to optimize the average diameter size of AuNPs using the Box Behnken design (BBD). The bio synthesized AuNPs are also found effective in degradation of Methylene Bule (MB), an electrophilic dye and Metanil Yellow (MY), an anionic azo dye. Overall, this study displays that cranberry-mediated AuNPs can be a sustainable substitute in biological and environmental applications, in addition to adding to the expanding corpus of research on green nanotechnology.

AB  - PURPOSE: International clinical practice guidelines addressing corticosteroid treatment for patients hospitalised with non-viral community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are inconsistent. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the use of corticosteroids in hospitalised adult patients with suspected or probable CAP. We performed random effects pairwise, Bayesian, and dose-response meta-analyses using the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) heterogeneity estimator. We assessed certainty of evidence using GRADE methodology. RESULTS: We identified 30 eligible RCTs, including a total of 7519 patients. The prednisone-equivalent doses ranged between 29 mg/day and 100 mg/day. Corticosteroids probably reduced short-term (28-30 days) mortality (RR 0.82 [95% CI 0.74-0.91]; moderate certainty) while the reduction in longer term (60-90 day) mortality is less certain (RR 0.89 [95% CI 0.76-1.03]; low certainty). Corticosteroids reduced the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (RR 0.63 [95% CI 0.48-0.82]; high certainty) and may reduce duration of ICU stay (MD 1.53 days fewer [95% CI 0.31-2.75 days fewer]; low certainty), and hospital stay (MD 2.30 days fewer [95% CI 0.81-3.81 days fewer]; low certainty). Corticosteroids probably increased hyperglycaemia requiring intervention (RR 1.32 [95% CI 1.12-1.56]; moderate certainty) but probably have no effect on secondary infections (RR 0.97 [95% CI 0.85-1.11]; moderate certainty). CONCLUSION: Corticosteroids probably reduced short-term mortality and reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation in hospitalised patients with CAP.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of tryptophan substitution on the properties of the Medisin family peptide MS-PT. By substituting hydrophobic amino acids in MS-PT1 with tryptophan, a series of derivative peptides were synthesized. Among them, the 7W peptide stood out with its unique N-terminal random curl and α-helix structure. In vitro, 7W effectively inhibited the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-α in LPS-induced Membrane-Proximal Macrophages (MPMs) by blocking the MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway. It also exhibited stronger antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria compared to the parent peptide MS-PT1, with good safety as indicated by a low hemolysis rate. In vivo, in the CLP-induced sepsis mouse model, 7W alleviated lung and liver injury, suppressed the expression of inflammatory factors in serum and tissues, and had a relatively long plasma half-life of 46.8 h. Mechanistically, 7W interacted preferentially with bacterial mimic membranes and LPS, and its anti-inflammatory effect might be mediated by binding to TLR4. These findings not only clarify the role of tryptophan substitution in modulating peptide properties but also offer a new strategy for the development of multifunctional antimicrobial peptides, suggesting that 7W has great potential as a therapeutic agent for sepsis and other inflammatory diseases.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effects of date palm pollen (DPP) supplementation in the diet of Japanese quail on growth performance, carcass characteristics, blood biomarkers, and intestinal bacterial load. A total of 360 unsexed one-day-old Japanese quail chicks were randomly assigned to four experimental groups using a completely randomized design. Each group was further subdivided into three replicates, each consisting of 30 chicks. In the experiment, the first group was given control (basal diet); the second group was given the same basal diet plus 3 g/kg of DPP; the third group was given the same basal diet plus 5 g/kg of DPP; and the fourth group was given the same basal diet plus 7 g/kg of DPP. The results revealed significant differences between treatments, with DPP supplementation leading to increased body weight (BW) and body weight gain (BWG) during the initial weeks (P < 0.05), and these differences became more pronounced (P < 0.01) in the later stages of the study. Additionally, the DPP-treated groups demonstrated lower feed intake (FI) and improved feed conversion ratio (FCR) than the control group. Supplementation with DPP significantly (P < 0.05) influenced carcass, liver, spleen, thymus, and bursa percentage. The addition of DPP to the quail diet significantly impacted (P < 0.01) all hematological parameters, except for red blood cell concentration. Biochemical analysis showed a significant increase (P < 0.01) in total protein, albumin, globulin, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels in the DPP groups. In contrast, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), urea, creatinine, cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were significantly reduced (P < 0.01). DPP supplementation had a significant impact on antioxidant enzyme activities, with the 5 g/kg and 7 g/kg DPP groups showing significant increases (P < 0.01) in total antioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT) levels. Furthermore, malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) concentrations were significantly reduced (P < 0.01). According to microbiological tests, the DPP-treated groups had reduced Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus levels. In summary, adding DPP to the diet of Japanese quail enhances their gut microbiota composition, growth performance, carcass characteristics, and biochemical markers.

AB  - The rising threat of antibiotic resistance demands innovative approaches to combat infectious diseases. This study explores new thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-based hybrid compounds targeting dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS), a critical enzyme in bacterial folate synthesis but absent in human cells. The compounds were designed using bioisosteric replacements and spacer variations. Biological evaluations revealed promising activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Compounds 5b, 14a, and 14b exhibited potent antibacterial effects with MIC values as low as 4 μg/mL for 5b. Time-dependent killing studies demonstrated rapid bactericidal action, superior to vancomycin for 5b and 14b. Additionally, these compounds disrupted biofilm formation and eradicated established biofilms. Plasma stability assays showed reduced efficacy in complex fluids, indicating potential challenges in clinical application. Notably, resistance development against 5b was minimal, underscoring its potential as a durable antimicrobial agent. This study underscores the promise of targeting conserved DHPS sites in developing effective treatments for resistant Gram-positive infections while addressing biofilm-related challenges in chronic infections.

AB  - Cancer metastasis is the leading cause of death in patients. In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the role of tumor-associated microflora in tumor metastasis. The connection between oral and gut microflora and the tumor microenvironment has also been extensively studied. The migration of oral and gut microflora is closely associated with tumor development. Although there is awareness regarding the significant impact of microbial communities on human health, the focus on their relationship with host organisms, particularly those related to tumor-associated microflora, remains inadequate. As an integral part of the body, the host microflora is crucial for regulating the cancer risk and preventing tumor recurrence. The oral-gut axis plays an indispensable role in human immunity, and many types of cancers, such as colorectal, pancreatic, and breast, are significantly influenced by their internal microbial communities. However, further exploration into the mechanisms underlying the role of the intratumoral microflora in cancer is necessary to achieve a comprehensive understanding. We have summarized and analyzed related articles in PubMed. This article reviews the impact of the oral-gut axis on the human immune system, explores the relationship between the translocation of the oral and intestinal flora and the tumor microenvironment, analyzes the specific mechanisms involved in the translocation of the oral and intestinal microflora during the evolution and progression of tumors, and elaborates on the correlations between the occurrence and development of tumors and the changes in the microflora. Finally, a summary of these abovementioned points is provided.

AB  - RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is widely used in biomedical research, advancing our understanding of gene expression across biological systems. Traditional methods require upstream RNA extraction from biological inputs, adding time and expense to workflows. We developed TIRE-seq (Turbocapture Integrated RNA Expression Sequencing) to address these challenges. TIRE-seq integrates mRNA purification directly into library preparation, eliminating the need for a separate extraction step. This streamlined approach reduces turnaround time, minimizes sample loss, and improves data quality. A comparative study with the widely used Prime-seq protocol demonstrates TIRE-seq's superior sequencing efficiency with crude cell lysates as inputs. TIRE-seq's utility was demonstrated across three biological applications. It captured transcriptional changes in stimulated human T cells, revealing activation-associated gene expression profiles. It also identified key genes driving murine dendritic cell differentiation, providing insights into lineage commitment. Lastly, TIRE-seq analyzed the dose-response and time-course effects of temozolomide on patient-derived neurospheres, identifying differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways linked to the drug's mechanism of action. With its simplified workflow and high sequencing efficiency, TIRE-seq offers a cost-effective solution for large-scale gene expression studies across diverse biological systems.

AB  - The use of fecally polluted water increases the risk of crop contamination with human norovirus (HuNoV) and its transmission to humans, particularly through ready-to-eat foods such as fresh produce. Preventing such exposure at preharvest stages is critical to ensure food safety throughout the supply chain. Despite HuNoV being the leading cause of foodborne illnesses in the United States, effective mitigating strategies in preharvest agricultural water remain underdeveloped. This research evaluated the effectiveness of calcium hypochlorite, a commercially available sanitizer to inactivate the Tulane virus, a surrogate for HuNoV, and Escherichia coli TVS 353 in preharvest agricultural waters. Water samples from two Florida farms were collected and inoculated with each microbial type, then treated with different free chlorine dosages (2, 4, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 ppm) for 5 and 10 min. The treatments were conducted at 12 °C to reflect colder months in Florida, aligning with the temperature specification outlined in the EPA/FDA protocol. Microbial counts were performed using plaque assay for Tulane virus and plate counts for E. coli. Since increasing the contact time from 5 to 10 min did not significantly enhance microbial inactivation rates (p > 0.05), kinetic models were fit to inactivation data for the 5-min contact time.

AB  - Macrocyclic supramolecular materials such as pillar[n]arenes play a prominent role in enhancing antibacterial activity through host-guest interactions. Herein, the water-soluble pillar[5]arene imidazole-1 and pillar[5]arene imidazole-2 were prepared, and their structure and chemical compositions were analyzed through multiple characterization methods. Afterward, the prepared imidazole-functionalized pillar[5]arenes were examined for antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella typhimurium bacteria. Also, the antioxidant activities of the prepared imidazole-functionalized pillar[5]arenes were investigated using 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl. In addition, the catalytic activities of pillar[5]arene imidazole-1 and pillar[5]arene imidazole-2 by reduction of 4-nitrophenol were studied, indicating the catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol was 93.0 % for the pillar[5]arene imidazole-1 catalyst at 18 min. Comparison of the reactivity of pillar[5]arene imidazole-1 with that of pillar[5]arene imidazole-2 shows an increase in antibacterial and catalytic activity. This study summarized that using suitable catalysts, catalytic reduction aims to convert the most harmful and toxic organic compound 4-nitrophenol into non-toxic 4-aminophenol and popularize it in industry.

Previous bioinformatic analysis identified a candidate biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of ctd for carpatamides in Streptomyces parvus 1268. Through heterologous expression of ctd and subsequent fermentation and isolation, we have identified five novel carpatamide derivatives of carpatamides N - R (1-5), and a known compound of daryamide A (6). The structures and absolute configurations of compounds 1-6 were determined by ESI-HRMS, NMR, and ECD calculations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, a cost-saving, dose-reducing strategy for cefiderocol against gram-negative bacteria with low cefiderocol minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) was proposed as an alternative to the standard dosing (ie, 2 g every 8 hours, 3-hours infusion). The objectives of this article are to summarize the available evidence on the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics of cefiderocol to support the rationale of the approved dosing and to assess any risk of underexposure with reduced doses (ie, 1 g every 8 hours or 12 hours) regarding higher cefiderocol MICs. METHODS: Published data from phase 1-3 clinical, preclinical effectiveness, and surveillance studies were reviewed, and new population PK simulations were conducted. RESULTS: Most carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates displayed cefiderocol MICs up to 4 mg/L. Single or multiple doses of cefiderocol, up to 4 g, were tested in phase 1 clinical studies, which confirmed a linear PK profile, low metabolism, renal clearance, and penetration into the lungs and soft tissues. Phase 2-3 randomized controlled clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of cefiderocol at 2 g every 8 hours or renally adjusted doses versus comparators in patients with complicated urinary tract infections, nosocomial pneumonia, and bloodstream infection/sepsis caused by various carbapenem-susceptible or -resistant gram-negative pathogens. Population PK models incorporating clinical data predicted that the approved dosing regimen of cefiderocol, in contrast to reduced doses, would achieve high probability of target attainment against gram-negative isolates, with cefiderocol MICs of 2-4 mg/L across various infection types and patient populations. CONCLUSIONS: Administering low-dose cefiderocol to reduce treatment-related costs will lead to treatment failure and prolonged hospitalization and incur further expenses. Therefore, the approved cefiderocol dosing regimen is strongly recommended.

This finding highlights that infection results in strong acquired immunity, effectively blocking subsequent infections. A quantitative dose-response model suggests that the relationship between egg dose and the number of viable cysts is best described by a power relationship. Combining data from single-infection and reinfected pigs into a unified model improved prediction precision. Finally, incorporating age at infection results in a model of the number of viable cysts in pigs depending on dose and age that combines acquired and innate immunity effects, i.e. changes in susceptibility with age.

AB  - Drinking water opportunistic pathogens (OPs) and disinfection byproducts (DBPs) both pose risks to public health, and their variable occurrence from source to tap complicates efforts to control them simultaneously. Management of OPs and DBPs is further hindered by the historical division between microbial and chemical research. This review brings together the current knowledge regarding OPs and DBPs, identifies factors that influence the occurrence of both, and highlights areas where research is needed to better understand their health risks. First, we examine the current understanding of how OPs and DBPs are jointly influenced by physicochemical parameters, source water characteristics, treatment processes including disinfection, and distribution system properties. Temperature, for example, can affect OP and DBP occurrence, where higher temperatures can promote the growth of some OPs, such as

Their structures were elucidated using a combination of spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D NMR and HRESIMS, while their absolute configurations were determined through single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and ECD calculations. Among the isolates, compound 2 featured a δ-lactone moiety as the D-ring, representing the first report of such a structural novelty in cycloartane triterpenoids. Biological evaluations revealed that most isolated cycloartane triterpenoids exhibited moderate to weak cytotoxicity, while the flavones showed stronger cytotoxic effects. Notably, flavone 27 exhibited potent cytotoxicity against the A549, MOLT-3, and HepG2 cell lines (IC

AB  - As antibiotic resistance increases and new drug development lags, the effectiveness of single antibiotics has drastically diminished for clinical infection treatment. The resistance crisis is exacerbated by the swift development and dissemination of Gram-negative bacteria that are extensively drug-resistant (XDR), particularly strains resistant to carbapenems in clinical settings. In this scenario, antibiotic adjuvants play a crucial role in revitalizing existing treatments to combat carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections. In this study, we synthesized ten small molecular antimicrobial peptide mimics and identified antimicrobial peptide mimic 329 (A329), which exhibited a synergistic effect with minocycline (FICI = 0.023), enhancing its efficacy by 4- to 128-fold, and significantly enhanced the antibacterial efficacy of minocycline against carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP, 0.015 ≤ FICI ≤0.141), prevented the emergence of minocycline resistance, improved the survival rate of mice, and decreased bacterial load in tissues at 8 + 8 mg/kg. Mechanistic studies revealed that A329 increases bacterial membrane permeability and disrupts the proton-motive force. Additionally, A329 combined with minocycline boosts intracellular minocycline accumulation, induces intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ultimately triggers bacterial death. These findings advised that A329 in combination with minocycline is a potential combination therapy against XDR-associated infections.

AB  - There is a growing need in the personal hygiene industry to develop a new generation of effective antimicrobial actives, to be used as functional antibacterial ingredients and preservatives. Antimicrobials that attack bacterial membranes are an attractive target due to the relatively conserved structure compositions of the bacterial membrane, which bacteria cannot easily change without influences on the function of membrane-embedded proteins. However, current screening is slow and there is a demand for rapid screening methodologies to overcome the time-consuming nature of existing screening tools. Imaging total internal reflection-fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (ITIR-FCS) is a powerful technique that can measure membrane dynamics and identify changes with high accuracy and precision. We therefore combine ITIR-FCS with a segmentation algorithm to automatically identify bacterial cells to screen the effect of antimicrobial compounds on the dynamics of bacterial membranes as a function of antimicrobial concentration and incubation time. This allows to assess membrane activity within less than 30 min and generates dose-response curves within a span of 2 h. The technique detects antimicrobial activity at lower concentrations and an order of magnitude faster than commonly used susceptibility testing assays.

AB  - The dense biofilm architecture and efflux pump activity play critical roles in Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections by hindering the accumulation and long-term efficacy of antibacterial agents within bacterial cells. The development of engineered nanoparticles capable of penetrating the polysaccharide matrix of biofilms represents a promising strategy for addressing bacterial infections. This is the first report on the synthesis of quercetin-functionalized PEGylated ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO-PEG-QUE NPs) and the evaluation of their anti-biofilm activity against pathogenic strains of P. aeruginosa. The synthesized NPs exhibited spherical shapes with an average size of 59.52 nm. ZnO-PEG-QUE NPs demonstrated biofilm inhibitory levels between 49 % and 67 %, and significantly reduced the production of total exopolysaccharides, alginate, and pellicle by 64.61 %-71.69 %, 30.47 %-45.36 %, and 24.22 %-85.97 %, respectively. ZnO-PEG-QUE NPs not only inhibited early-stage biofilm formation but also disrupted mature biofilms, indicating a dual mode of action against both biofilm development and persistence. Based on our findings, ZnO-PEG-QUE NPs effectively eradicated mature biofilms by 67.2 %-72 % and significantly reduced the metabolic activity and viable cells of preformed biofilms to 34.12 %-55.57 % and 6.25-8.15 log CFU, respectively. Electron and fluorescence microscopy analyses also confirmed the antibiofilm potential of ZnO-PEG-QUE NPs. Furthermore, bacterial adhesion and invasion to HDF cells were significantly diminished in the NP-treated groups. The attenuation of efflux pump activity in the NP-treated strains was confirmed using the EtBr-agar cartwheel assay. Taken together, these findings highlight the therapeutic potential of ZnO-PEG-QUE NPs as a novel and effective strategy to combat biofilm-associated infections, warranting further investigation in preclinical models.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We have previously identified methyl rosmarinic (MR) acid as a 2.3-bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM) activator. The present study aimed to verify the protective effect of MR on plateau field hypoxia mice and the mechanism of increased oxygen release capacity of erythrocytes in vivo. METHODS: The anti-hypoxic effect of MR was investigated in a plateau field environment in Specific Pathogen Free -grade healthy BALB/c mice, male and female, and the effect of different doses of MR on the survival time of mice in confined space was investigated in an atmospheric pressure confinement hypoxia experiment, plasma inflammatory markers, oxidative stress indices of myocardial, brain, lung and liver tissues, as well as the histopathological damage and hypoxia in each experimental group were measured by HE staining and hypoxia probe method. Finally, the effects of MR administration to mice on the energy metabolic pathways and metabolites of erythrocytes in vivo were investigated. RESULTS: After acute plateau entry in mice, the energy metabolic pathway of erythrocytes shifted to the glycolytic pathway as the duration of hypoxia increased. The administration of MR to hypoxic mice further activated Bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM) and increased the levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and 2.3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG), as well as further shifted glucose to the glycolytic pathway and further enhanced the activity of rate-limiting enzymes in the glycolytic pathway. CONCLUSIONS: MR activates BPGM in erythrocytes to produce more 2, 3-BPG from the glycolytic branch, thus exerting a protective effect against injury in hypoxic mice in the highland field.

AB  - One new phenolic derivative diameliresorcin (1), one new natural product N-(2'-oxopiperidin-3'-yl) picolinamide (2), one new α-pyrone derivative diameliphyone (3), and six known secondary metabolites (4-9) were isolated from the Ligia exotica-derived fungus Diaporthe melitensis HZ-1. The structures of three new compounds were identified by IR, NMR, and HR-ESI-MS, whereas their absolute configurations were validated either through single-crystal x-ray diffraction analysis or via time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)-electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations. It is noted that the absolute configuration of compound 2 was determined for the first time. Meanwhile, all the isolated compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activities. Among them, diameliresorcin (1) exhibited weak anti-Vibrio vulnificus activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 46 µg/mL.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae threatens the efficacy of ceftriaxone, the last widely effective treatment for gonorrhea. Resistance mechanisms challenge the adequacy of current dosing strategies and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) thresholds, with treatment failures documented at MICs as low as 0.125 mcg/mL. Limited clinical and pharmacodynamic data complicate efforts to define optimal dosing and resistance breakpoints. AREAS COVERED: This review examines the evolution of ceftriaxone dosing recommendations in response to resistance trends, explores the genetic and pharmacokinetic factors driving reduced susceptibility, and critically evaluates the CDC's MIC 'alert value' of 0.125 mcg/mL. Surveillance data are analyzed alongside pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models, including Monte Carlo simulations and hollow fiber infection models (HFIM). Practical challenges, including injection site tolerability, lidocaine safety, and dosing limits for intramuscular administration, are reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: Current PK/PD data and IV tolerability studies support ceftriaxone dose escalation up to 3.5 g IM as a feasible outpatient limit for strains with MICs up to 0.5 mcg/mL. However, the MIC at which even high-dose regimens fail remains unknown. Urgent priorities include validating higher doses through clinical pharmacokinetic and outcomes studies, refining MIC thresholds by anatomical site, and evaluating novel agents for reliable pharyngeal eradication.

AB  - Climate and socio-economic changes are expected to significantly impact waterborne pathogens and associated health risks, yet the full extent of these effects remains unclear. Accurate quantification of these risks is crucial for informing effective interventions and policy decisions. Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) serves as a valuable tool for estimating the risk of infection caused by microorganisms in drinking water. This study reviews existing QMRA studies and tools in the context of surface water and drinking water provision. Most studies have implemented various steps of the QMRA framework but often without the application of specific QMRA tools. Although several QMRA tools address climatic factors, there are currently no tools that integrate socio-economic factors into their risk assessments. This study proposes an approach for incorporating both climatic and socio-economic factors into QMRA tools. Specifically, we suggest enhancements to the Swedish QMRA tool - an open-source tool that currently does not incorporate climate and socio-economic changes. Our proposed advancements aim to systematically account for future climatic and socio-economic impacts on health risks, providing a more comprehensive microbial risk assessment tool. These recommendations are also applicable to other QMRA tools, offering a pathway for their development and improving the overall assessment of microbial health risks.

AB  - The time-dose reciprocity has long been a cornerstone in understanding ultraviolet (UV) sterilization. However, recent studies have demonstrated significant deviations from this law, attributed to complex mechanisms involving reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study investigates whether similar deviations occur at much shorter wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation than UV, specifically in the X-ray region, with a focus on the dose-rate dependence of bacterial inactivation. Using Escherichia coli as a model organism, it is found that dose-rate effects were highly dependent on the bacterial growth phase. In the stationary phase, lower dose rates with prolonged irradiation resulted in greater inactivation efficacy. The inactivation ratio obtained by the dose rate of 15.3 mGy/s shows more than 3 times larger than that obtained by the dose rate of 147 mGy/s at the dose of 200 Gy, which is consistent with findings from previous UV studies. On the other hand, in the exponential phase, higher dose rates with shorter irradiation durations were more effective. The inactivation ratio obtained by the dose rate of 147 mGy/s shows 40 times larger than that obtained by the dose rate of 15.3 mGy/s at the dose of 200 Gy. These results can be effectively explained by a stochastic multi-hit model that accounts for three terms of linearly proportional to dose, nonlinearly proportional to dose, and binary fission. This work bridges fundamental physical biology with practical applications, such as gamma sterilization, offering a robust framework for optimizing dose-rate strategies across diverse fields.

AB  - This study describes the green synthesis, characterization, and biological evaluation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) obtained from green propolis (AgNPs-PRO). Before nanoparticles synthesis, a hydroethanolic green propolis extract (GPE) was obtained through ultrasound-assisted extraction and characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography, revealing the artepilin C as the most abundant phenolic compound in its composition, followed by 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid and drupanin. The analysis of synthesized AgNPs by UV-Vis spectroscopy showed a characteristic absorption band at 430 nm. Dynamic light scattering analysis revealed mean hydrodynamic particle sizes ranging from 88 to 115 nm, with a polydispersity index between 0.229 ± 0.006 and 0.365 ± 0.054. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed that functional groups present in GPE contribute to the reduction and stabilization of AgNPs. Differential scanning calorimetry and transmission electron microscopy confirmed that AgNPs were obtained. GPE showed leishmanicidal activity against promastigote forms of Leishmania amazonensis, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC

AB  - Although toxicity of alcohol toward the intestines and immunity is mentioned, there might be different effect of alcohol in a low and a high dose and the rodent model development using a simple SHIRPA binary score night be useful. Hence, a low and high dose of alcohol (6.30 and 1.26 g/kg/day) were administered in might for 16 weeks before determination of several parameters. As such, the peak blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of low and high dose of alcohol were approximately at 0.05 and 0.15%, respectively, at 1 h post-administration, which correlated with SHIRPA score at 1.8 ± 0.8 and 7.2 ± 0.6, respectively. After 16 wk of administration, a significant liver injury in high-dose alcohol was indicated by liver enzymes, liver weight, histology score, apoptosis, and hepatic accumulation of triglyceride (TG) and oxidative stress (malondialdehyde; MDA) with reduced anti-oxidant (glutathione). Meanwhile, low-dose alcohol demonstrated only elevated apoptosis with increased TG and MDA in liver tissue. Leaky gut from both dose of alcohol was also demonstrated by FITC-dextran, endotoxemia, serum beta glucan, and reduced occludin. However, bacterial abundance (microbiome analysis) of the feces from small bowel of high-dose alcohol, but not the low dose, was different from the control (increased Alitipes spp. with reduced Lachnospiraceae). In conclusion, both low- and high-dose alcohol induced leaky gut, while only the high-dose caused gut dysbiosis and alcohol damaged mitochondria but enhanced glycolysis in enterocytes and macrophages. Leaky gut might be more sensitive than dysbiosis to determine alcohol-induced intestinal injury.

AB  - The process of infection of a host is complex, influenced by factors such as microbial variation within and between hosts as well as differences in dose across hosts. This study uses dose-response and within-host microbial infection models to delve into the impact of these factors on infection probability. It is rigorously demonstrated that within-host heterogeneity in microbial infectivity enhances the probability of infection. The effect of infectivity and dose variation between hosts is studied in terms of the expected value of the probability of infection. General analytical findings, derived under the assumption of small infectivity, reveal that both types of heterogeneity reduce the expected infection probability. Interestingly, this trend appears consistent across specific dose-response models, suggesting a limited role for the small infectivity condition. Additionally, the vital dynamics behind heterogeneous infectivity are investigated with a within-host microbial growth model which enhances the biological significance of single-hit dose-response models. Testing these mathematical predictions inspire new and challenging laboratory experiments that could deepen our understanding of infections.

AB  - Unique hydroxyphenyl cyanovinyl thiazoles (HCTs) as new structural scaffolds of potential antibacterial agents were developed to overcome global increasingly serious drug resistance. Some synthesized HCTs could suppress the growth of the tested strains, especially, benzothiophenyl HCT 5c exhibited superior anti-Escherichia coli activity with a lower MIC of 0.5 μg/mL to norfloxacin (MIC = 1 μg/mL). The active benzothiophenyl HCT 5c displayed no obvious hemolysis, low cytotoxicity and a much lower trend for the development of drug-resistance than norfloxacin. Further exploration revealed that benzothiophenyl HCT 5c could intercalate to DNA to form a DNA-5c complex, which disturbed the biological functions to facilitate bacterial death. ADME analysis indicated that compound 5c possessed favorable druggability and promising pharmacokinetic properties. This work provided an insight into further developing hydroxyphenyl cyanovinyl thiazoles as new structural scaffold of promising antibacterial candidates.

AB  - Self-assembled antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have superior antimicrobial properties from their supramolecular nanostructures. A systematic study is needed to determine which AMPs can generate more significant self-assembled structures for antimicrobial activity. In this study, thirty-six self-assembled AMPs were systematically designed by combining six hexapeptide sequences with five aromatic groups, exploring the contributions of different sequences and groups to self-assembly and antimicrobial properties. Most peptides had broad-spectrum antimicrobial and self-assembly capabilities. Moderate self-assembly can endow these new AMPs with excellent antimicrobial properties. Candidate peptides Nap-f5f6 and Npx-f5f6 had outstanding antimicrobial activity, low toxicity, and high selectivity. This may be due to their self-assembly into nanofibers and nanospheres via π-π stacking provided by C- and N-terminal aromatic groups. Their membrane-disrupting bactericidal mechanism gives a rapid effect and prevents antibiotic resistance. Also, in infected mouse skin wounds, Nap-f5f6 and Npx-f5f6 had low toxicity, reduced bacterial load, and accelerated wound healing.

AB  - Microorganisms serve as critical resources for the discovery of new antibacterial drug leads. Herein, we report the screening, isolation, and identification of tyrcinnamin (1) from the endophytic Streptomyces sp. JS-B1. The total synthesis, biological evaluation, and structural-activity relationship study of tyrcinnamin and its synthetic derivatives led to the discovery of 7a, a promising lead compound with significant antibacterial activity, notable tyrosinase activation activity, and an excellent safety profile. The analysis of molecular docking of 7a with mushroom tyrosinase reveals that 7a may competitively occupy the binding site of l-DOPA on the surface of tyrosinase without interfering with the substrate binding at the active center, thereby reducing the ineffective occupancy of l-DOPA on the tyrosinase surface and improving the binding efficiency of l-DOPA at the active center. The structure of 7a represents a new chemical scaffold for the development of new antibiotics and tyrosinase activators, making valuable contributions to both drug discovery and cosmetics development.

AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major cause of hospitalizations and mortality from bacterial infections and is considered a national priority for disease control. In this work we synthesized and evaluated twenty novel C-3 arylazo-coupled indoles and one 4-arylazo-benzo[d]imidazole. The substituents on the C3-aromatic moiety included alkyl, halogen, amino, alkoxy, alkylsulfonyl at positions ortho, meta and para. The indoles utilized were 4-bromo, 5,6-methylenedioxy, 7-aza. In this effort, several azo-indoles showed promising anti-MRSA activities with MIC values as low as 3 μM. Another important finding of this work that sets that stage for a further larger investigation is that 4-arylazo-benzo[d]imidazole is a previously unexplored scaffold with potent anti-MRSA activity.

Metal-based complexes, particularly gallium-containing compounds, offer promising therapeutic avenues due to their unique mechanisms of action. To identify novel scaffolds for such complexes, we performed a comprehensive genomic analysis of Nocardia species, revealing the prevalence of siderophore biosynthetic gene clusters, including the highly conserved nocobactin NA-like clusters. From N. coubleae DSM 44960, we isolated three new siderophores, coublibactins A-C (1-3), along with eight congeners (4-11) with known planar structures, all characterized by exceptional iron-binding affinity. Subsequent gallium substitution yielded gallium complexes (Ga-1-11). Among these, Ga-6 exhibited significant anticancer activity against human acute promyelocytic leukemia NB4 cells with IC

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) have a 2%-4% annual risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Understanding hemorrhage risk is crucial for determining appropriate treatment. The degree to which cerebral blood flow within AVMs interplays with angioarchitecture and contributes to potential rupture represents an active area of research. Prior studies have shown conflicting results; those based on quantitative MR angiography (QMRA) have found lower flow associated with hemorrhage, while those using angiography-determined transit time associated higher flow with rupture. METHODS: A prospectively collected institutional database of 647 adult patients with cerebral AVMs (1995-2023) was queried. Patients with baseline QMRA studies were included in the analysis. Patient characteristics, angioarchitectural information, and hemodynamic data were collected for each patient and compared between those who presented with and those who presented without hemorrhage. RESULTS: A total of 171 patients met the inclusion criteria; 105 patients had unruptured AVMs and 66 had ruptured AVMs at presentation. The mean age did not differ between groups (39.4 years vs 39.9 years), but there was male predominance in the rupture group (67.7%, p = 0.023). A deep AVM location was more likely in those with rupture (p = 0.002). The mean calculated AVM flow was lower in the rupture group (284.3 mL/min vs 401.8 mL/min, p = 0.013). Additionally, the mean AVM volume was smaller in the rupture group (8.8 cm3 vs 14.5 cm3, p = 0.040). The mean number of arterial feeders did not differ between groups (2.4 vs 2.4, p = 0.986), but the mean size of the largest feeder was smaller in those presenting with hemorrhage (2.6 vs 3.0 mm, p = 0.038). Furthermore, ruptured AVMs were more likely to have deep venous drainage (p = 0.007) and fewer draining veins (mean 1.9 vs 2.4, p = 0.020) than unruptured AVMs. The presence of feeder aneurysms, intranidal aneurysms, and nidal compactness did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with baseline QMRA studies who presented with ruptured AVMs were noted to have a deep location, deep venous drainage, lower flow, smaller nidal volume, smaller arterial feeders, and fewer draining veins compared with those with unruptured AVMs. These findings validate results from smaller prior studies based on QMRA.

AB  - Ultraviolet-light emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) have garnered attention for their efficient bacterial inactivation. However, in previous studies, it has been difficult to strictly compare the bacterial inactivation effect of UV irradiation among wavelengths differing by a few nanometers because detailed UV irradiation conditions for comparison, such as the LED characteristics at each wavelength and power supply characteristics, have not been established. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate UV inactivation of 10 bacterial strains across 13 wavelengths (250-365 nm) using a standardized irradiation system previously reported to identify the most effective wavelengths for prevention of bacterial infection and contamination. Bacterial inactivation dose response curves were generated to determine the fluence required to archive 1-3 log

AB  - Ozone is a powerful disinfectant that is widely used in the bottled water (BW) industry. Primary ozone disinfection of water for bottling occurs in a reaction tank with a specific contact time. Residual ozone in the bottled water may still possess disinfection activity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of residual ozone in BW in reducing the populations of surrogate microorganisms for waterborne pathogens (Escherichia coli [BAA-1427], Enterococcus faecalis [ATCC 19433] and Burkholderia cepacia [ATCC 25416]). The effect of water pH and total dissolved solids (TDS) on the disinfection process was also evaluated. A pilot scale ozone delivery system and filler were assembled to allow filling of 0.5 L polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic water bottles with ozonated (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mg/L) water. Ozonated water was inoculated with microorganisms to attain ca. 6.0 log and 4.0 log CFU/mL, and microbial populations were determined after 5, 30, 60, and 180 min at 25 °C. Samples (100 mL) were filtered through Neogen NEO-GRID membrane filters and placed on tryptic soy agar, incubated for 48 h at 37 °C, and enumerated. Ozone dissipation in BW was measured with and without biological load (6.0 log CFU/mL) at 21 and 38°C for 6 h. Greater reductions (P ≤ 0.05) in E. faecalis (4.61 and 3.68 log CFU/mL) and B. cepacia (5.24 and 4.12 log CFU/mL) were observed at 0.4 and 0.1 mg/L ozone in BW, respectively. Longer contact time (>5 min) did not result in greater reduction (P > 0.05) in microbial populations. Faster ozone dissipation (P ≤ 0.05) was observed at 38 °C and the dissipation rate increased with biological load. Except at higher pH (9.0) and TDS (50 and 300 mg/L) concentrations, the residual ozone in BW (≥0.1 mg/L) can provide ≥4.0 log reductions in pathogen surrogates E. coli, E. faecalis, and B. cepacia, providing an additional measure of microbiological safety in BW.

AB  - Microbial metabolites serve as a vital source for drug discovery, with diphenyl ether derivatives from Aspergillus sp. garnering significant attention due to their antimicrobial activities. This work focused on the antibacterial compounds from the fungi Aspergillus versicolor YC-27, which led to the isolation of one new diphenyl ether derivative, aspesicol (1), together with eight known compounds (2-9). The structure of the new compound was elucidated by spectroscopic methods, high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance calculations with DP4+ methods. In the in vitro bioassays, compounds 4, 5, and 9 exhibited good inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 8 µg/mL, and compound 6 showed potent inhibitory activity against S. aureus with MIC value of 4 µg/mL. These diphenyl ether derivatives demonstrating significant antimicrobial activity, particularly compound 6, represent highly promising lead candidates for the development of therapeutic agents against multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.

In fact, resistance has developed not only to vancomycin but also to other clinically used agents, such as daptomycin and linezolid. We propose a novel drug design approach merging tedizolid, a second-generation oxazolidinone used as an unapproved salvage therapy in clinical settings, with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) recently validated as functioning decolonization agents.

AB  - CGA-N9 is an antifungal peptide that primarily targets Candida spp. with a mild activity. Our preceding research confirmed that the CGA-N9 crosses cell membrane with the assistance of C. tropicalis oligopeptide transporter (CtOPT) -1 and - 9. In this study, CGA-N9-derived peptides were designed following the molecular docking results with CtOPT-1 and -9. Compared with CGAN9, they exhibit higher transmembrane efficiency with the assistance of CtOPT-1 during the early phase of transmembrane processes and CtOPT-9 in the late phase. And they displayed significantly enhanced antifungal activity, with lower minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against C. tropicalis, C. albicans, and C. parapsilosis, as well as improved biosafety. Among them, CGAN93 was the most optimizing, with a therapeutic index of 145.33. Furthermore, in a mouse model of systemic candidiasis, CGAN93 demonstrated a therapeutic effect comparable to fluconazole, significantly improving the survival rate of mice, attenuating organ damage, and enhancing the immune organ index. In conclusion, OPTs-based computer aided design is an effective strategy for enhancing the activities of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) by improving transmembrane transport efficiency. CGAN93 is a promising drug candidate for treating Candidiasis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Due to inadequate hygienic practices and improper handling, street foods may become contaminated, posing a significant risk for various foodborne diseases. This study aimed to determine the health risks to consumers from consuming street foods contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella. METHOD: A cross-sectional study design was used from December 2022 to February 2023 on the street foods of Addis Ababa, Hawassa, Dire Dawa, and Jimma towns. A total of 525 street foods were taken from 175 street food vending stalls. A stratified sampling technique was used to select vending stalls. A questionnaire was used to collect the data which were analyzed via SPSS-25. Food samples were analyzed at the Ethiopian Public Health Institute food microbiology laboratory using the standard microbiological methods used for the isolation, enumeration, and identification of bacteria. A quantitative microbial risk assessment was used to assess and determine the risk of infection using a deterministic approach. RESULT: The frequent, average, and occasional consumers of street foods were 26.9%, 52.6%, and 20.5% respectively. The prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus was 43.4% whereas 25.7% for Salmonella species. The risk of infection from S. aureus was higher than Salmonella. The mean annual risk of S aureus infection of consumers was 100%, 99%, and 93% for frequent, average, and occasional consumers respectively. A total of 32.6% of the sampled foods had greater than 104 CFU/g a colony count of Staphylococcus aureus whereas in 25.7% of the samples Salmonella exceeded the safety standards and made the food unfit for consumption. CONCLUSION: The results highlighted the significant risk of infection with Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella in Ethiopian street foods, and revealed that frequent consumption of street foods was associated with a high risk of infection. This urges improved hygiene practices to mitigate hazards and protect public health.

AB  - PURPOSE: To simulate the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) exposure of ceftazidime/avibactam (CZA) in children with gram-negative bacterial infections, and explore the appropriateness of the CZA standard dosing regimen (STD), further optimize the dosing regimen by extended/two-step infusion. METHODS: Monte Carlo simulations were performed to calculate the probability of target attainment (PTA) and cumulative fraction of response (CFR) of CZA with varying weight in two age groups (≥6-12 and ≥12-18 years old, respectively), utilizing PK parameters and PD data (from the EUCAST as well as the published data on US children). The simulated dosing regimens included STD and extended/two-step infusion. FINDINGS: When the PK/PD target for ceftazidime was set at 50% of time that free drug concentrations remain above the minimum inhibitory concentration of the pathogen during the dosing interval (50% fT > MIC), the CZA STD achieved PTAs of ≥90% at susceptibility breakpoint (MIC = 8 mg/L) for children in weighed 15-30 kg (≥6-12years old) and 35-45 kg (≥12-18 years old). However, when the PK/PD target for ceftazidime was set at 100% fT > MIC, none could achieve PTAs of ≥90%. The CFR results showed that the STD couldn't provide CFRs ≥90% in all children, but extended infusion or two-step infusion could achieve the target CFRs in all children based on the MIC distribution of US children, and improve the CFRs based on EUCAST's MIC distribution. Compared with extended infusion, two-step infusion could reduce total infusion time in partial patients. IMPLICATIONS: The current STD of CZA may not adequately meet the therapeutic requirements in children, thus it is recommended to optimize the dosing regimen by extended/two-step infusion or increasing the daily dose, guided by therapeutic drug monitoring.

AB  - Vancomycin has long been considered as the last-resort antibiotic for tacking extremely severe infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). However, its clinical application is limited by dose-limiting nephrotoxicity. In this study, we report a novel in situ albumin conjugation and acid sensitive prodrug strategy to selectively release vancomycin at the infection site, thereby minimizing the accumulation of vancomycin in the kidney and thus reducing its nephrotoxicity. We synthesized and evaluated four vancomycin prodrugs 13a-d and found that 13c effectively bound to plasma albumin in vitro, and released vancomycin rapidly at the infection site. Its therapeutic effect against MRSA USA300 infection was comparable to that of free vancomycin at 10 mg/kg. In vivo safety assessments demonstrated that 13c did not exhibit significant nephrotoxicity at 50 mg/kg, whereas vancomycin caused obvious nephrotoxicity at the same dose. This work represents the first example of utilizing albumin for targeted delivery of antibiotic to the bacterial infection site to mitigate the common dose-limiting nephrotoxicity of vancomycin, and this strategy may also be applicable to other aminoglycoside antibiotics with nephrotoxicity.

AB  - Biebersteinia multifida DC. is a wild therapeutic plant, traditionally used for various medicinal applications. The aim of the present study is to extract bioactive constituents from the plants' roots and synthesize copper nanoparticles (CuNPs). Ethanolic extraction of the plant's roots yielded 19 bioactive compounds, recognized through gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), mainly including citraconic anhydride, γ-sitosterol, and 2-furancarboxaldehyde. The prepared CuNPs have been fully characterized. The biological activity evaluations revealed these CuNPs possess acceptable antibacterial and antifungal activities. Furthermore, the CuNPs displayed significant cytotoxic potency toward "4T1 breast cancer cells" while showing a relatively low cell death rate against the normal "HEK-293 kidney cell". In conclusion, our findings showed that the CuNPs can be synthesized from B. multifida roots with a simple, fast, and eco-friendly procedure. These CuNPs are efficient in antimicrobial and anticancer activities.

AB  - Twelve thiazole-based Schiff bases derived from salicylaldehyde derivatives are efficiently prepared in the current study. A typical Hantzsch thiazole reaction was used to prepare the targeted molecules in 80%-92%. Therefore, a one-pot protocol was developed involving the reaction of salicylaldehydes, thiosemicarbazide, and the appropriate hydrazonyl chlorides in dioxane at reflux for 5-6 h in the presence of one equivalent of triethylamine. The new products were tested against six different American Type Culture Collection bacterial strains with the reference ciprofloxacin. In general, integrating an aryldiazenyl unit into the structure of the tested 4-methylthiazole-based Schiff bases at thiazole-C5 resulted in improved antibacterial activity. Moreover, Schiff bases linked to 5-((4-chlorophenyl)thio)methyl units outperformed their analogs linked to 5-(phenyl)thio)methyl units by 2-fold. Thiazole-based Schiff base linked to 5-((4-chlorophenyl)thio)methyl and 5-((4-methoxyphenyl)diazenyl) units showed the highest activity against all strains tested, particularly Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. It had minimum inhibitory concentration/minimum bactericidal concentration (MIC/MBC) up to 7.4/14.9 µM. Moreover, it demonstrated comparable Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) inhibitory activity to linezolid against two MRSA strains with MIC/MBC up to 7.4/29.8 µM.

AB  - As essential enzymes encoded by single genes, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) have long been considered promising drug targets for combating microbial infections. In this study, we developed a novel class of amino acid-ATP dual-site inhibitors of prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS) through the structural simplification of the intermediate product prolyl adenylate and its non-hydrolyzable mimic. The co-crystal structures of the compound PAA-5 bound to both Pseudomonas aeruginosa and human cytoplasmic ProRSs (PaProRS and HsPrors) were solved to high resolution. Utilizing the structural information gained, a fluorine scanning (F-scanning) strategy was applied to PAA-5, and the biochemical and biophysical assays demonstrated that fluorine substitutions at specific positions of PAA-5 selectively enhanced its activity against bacterial ProRS. The dual-fluorinated derivative PAA-38 exhibited the highest antibacterial potency, with a K

AB  - This study reports the design and synthesis of benzofuran-tethered sulfamoyl triazoles. These compounds are evaluated against two human carbonic anhydrases (hCA I and II) and three CAs from the bacterial pathogen mycobacterium TB (mtCA1-3). The findings indicate that molecules featuring triazolyl benzene-3-sulfonamide are significantly more selective for mtCA 1-3 than hCA I and II. In contrast, across the generated molecules, benzofuran with triazolyl benzene-4-sulfonamide demonstrates greater selectivity for hCA II than mtCAs. Among these compounds, 3F4 shows the greatest suppression of mtCA2, with a Ki value of 0.0052 μM. 4F1 demonstrates essential and focused inhibition of hCA II, with a Ki value of 0.0094 μM. Compound 3F4 is 439 times more selective to mtCA2 than hCA I and 47 times more selective than hCAII. Additionally, when examined for antitubercular activity, these compounds show minimum inhibitory concentration values for Mtb H37Rv strain inhibition in the range of moderate to good with 4-128 μg mL

AB  - Fusarium oxysporum (Fo), a pathogenic fungus threatening medicinal plants like Panax notoginseng, causes severe root rot. Linalool, the primary component of Alpinia officinarum Hance essential oil (EO), is a biologically active compound with demonstrated anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antioxidant properties. Notably, it has garnered considerable attention for its remarkable antifungal efficacy. In vitro studies revealed that linalool significantly inhibited Fo hyphal growth. At 12.08 mmol/L, spore germination decreased by 43%, whereas spore yield dropped by 99%. Transcriptomic analysis identified 562 upregulated and 4095 downregulated genes in the linalool-treated group. The upregulated genes were predominantly enriched in pathways related to metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and carbohydrate metabolism, indicating adaptive stress responses. Downregulated genes were primarily associated with the ribosome biogenesis, transcription, and spliceosome pathways, with ribosome biogenesis showing the most pronounced inhibition. Linalool treatment inactivated TORC1 (target of rapamycin complex 1), a crucial regulator of ribosomal biogenesis and protein synthesis. This disruption led to reduced expression of ribosome-related genes, severely impairing protein synthesis and fungal growth. The study highlights linalool's strong antifungal activity, primarily by targeting ribosome biogenesis. Future research should investigate its effects and safety in field applications, offering potential strategies for managing diseases in medicinal plants such as P. notoginseng.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) remains a major source of stroke world-wide, with high recurrence risk. Prior evaluation of posterior circulation ICAD patients enrolled in the prospective VERiTAS and MYRIAD studies revealed regional hypoperfusion assessed by large vessel flow measurements using quantitative MRA (QMRA) predicts subsequent stroke risk. We examined whether a similar approach to regional flow assessment predicted stroke risk in anterior circulation ICAD patients in MYRIAD. METHODS: MYRIAD enrolled patients with symptomatic 50-99 % stenosis of proximal intracranial artery. The primary outcome was recurrent ischemic stroke in the stenotic artery territory within one year. Flow was measured in the major intracranial arteries at baseline using QMRA. We designated patients as low or normal flow based on an algorithm assessing distal flow and collateral capacity using age-normalized middle cerebral artery (MCA) and hemispheric flows. Thresholds for flow status categorization were tested to determine the optimal algorithm for stroke risk prediction. RESULTS: Of 73 enrolled subjects with symptomatic anterior circulation ICAD, 7 (9.6 %) had recurrent stroke. Z-score thresholds for age-normalized flow were examined, from which we identified an optimal threshold of -1 for the MCA and -0.75 for hemispheric flow. Based on these thresholds, 24 (33 %) patients were categorized as low flow; recurrent stroke occurred in 21 % of low flow vs 4 % of normal flow patients (age adjusted OR 7.2, 95 % CI 1.2-43.2). In the full cohort of 99 subjects with anterior and posterior circulation ICAD, 11 (11.1 %) had recurrent stroke, with a higher recurrent stroke risk in low flow patients (21.4 % vs 7 %, age adjusted OR 3.8, 95 % CI 1.02-14.2). CONCLUSIONS: Distal flow status assessed through QMRA regional flow measurement appears to be similarly predictive for recurrent clinical stroke in both the anterior and posterior ciruclation. Identification of high-risk patients has implications for future investigation of therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Microbial contamination of water sources is a pressing global challenge, disproportionately affecting developing regions with inadequate infrastructure and limited access to safe drinking water. In the Global South, waterborne pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and helminths contribute to diseases like cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever, resulting in severe public health burdens. Predictive modeling emerges as a pivotal tool in addressing these challenges, offering data-driven insights to anticipate contamination events and optimize mitigation strategies. This review highlights the application of predictive modeling techniques-including machine learning, hydrological simulations, and quantitative microbial risk assessment -to identify contamination hotspots, forecast pathogen dynamics, and inform water resource allocation in the Global South. Predictive models enable targeted actions to improve water safety and lower the prevalence of waterborne diseases by combining environmental, socioeconomic, and climatic factors. Water resources in the Global South are increasingly vulnerability to microbial contamination, and the challenge is exacerbated by rapid urbanization, climate variability, and insufficient sanitation infrastructure. This review underscores the importance of region-specific modeling approaches. Case studies from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia demonstrated the efficacy of predictive modeling tools in guiding public health actions connected to environmental matrices, from prioritizing water treatment efforts to implementing early-warning systems during extreme weather events. Furthermore, the review explores integrating advanced technologies, such as remote sensing and artificial intelligence, into predictive frameworks, highlighting their potential to improve accuracy and scalability in resource-constrained settings. Increased funding for data collecting, predictive modeling tools, and cross-sectoral cooperation between local communities, non-governmental organizations, and governments are all recommended in the review. Such efforts are critical for developing resilient water systems capable of withstanding environmental stressors and ensuring sustainable access to safe drinking water. By leveraging predictive modeling as a core component of water management strategies, stakeholders can address microbial contamination challenges effectively, safeguard public health, and contribute to achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - To mitigate the scarcity of freshwater resources, humans have increasingly reused treated wastewater for various purposes, with irrigation accounting for over 70 % of daily water consumption. While wastewater reuse offers a sustainable solution for conserving potable and non-potable water, the reclamation and reuse processes can have environmental and health implications, including greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, and pathogen exposure. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been employed to assess the midpoint and endpoint level impacts, such as human disease burden. Likewise, quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) is a valuable tool for evaluating local risks, such as pathogen exposures during irrigation. Both the LCA (to quantify endpoint indicators of the human burden) and the QMRA tool (to quantify disease burden on human health) use a common metric, disability-adjusted life years (i.e., DALY), which is a measure of overall disease burden that represents the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability, or early death as per person per year (DALYpppy). By combining LCA and QMRA, we can quantitatively measure the health risks associated with wastewater reclamation and reuse. This study aims to estimate the accumulated health burden attributed to the operation of an anoxic/anoxic/oxic/oxic wastewater treatment process and the subsequent reuse of treated wastewater for agricultural irrigation, using the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Our findings indicate that the treatment operations contribute a global human health burden of 8.08×10

AB  - The widespread prevalence of bacterial plant diseases imposes a severe constraint on global food production and crop security. To address the growing challenge of bacterial resistance, there is an urgent demand to develop novel agrochemicals that combine high efficacy with low toxicity. In this study, a natural product modification strategy was employed to design new bactericidal candidates with an innovative cation mechanism. Tryptamine was employed as a precursor to synthesize 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carboline (THC) intermediates via the Pictet-Spengler reaction. Subsequent acylation enabled the introduction of 3-N-substituted propionyl group as flexible bridge chain through an aza-Michael reaction. The resulting racemic THC derivatives were then evaluated for their antimicrobial activity.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial disease that poses significant challenges in its treatment. It requires prolonged use of high doses of medication, which can lead to various side effects. These side effects often contribute to low patient adherence to treatment, thereby increasing the risk of developing drug-resistant strains. The SQ109 is a second-generation agent developed from ethambutol that has been emerging as a promising TB agent. The functionalization of its skeleton appears as a strategy to improve the physicochemical and biological properties. Hence, we report the synthesis of functionalized SQ109 scaffolds, the in vitro evaluation against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv strains, molecular docking simulations, and molecular dynamics of the interactions with the target membrane protein.

AB  - Five previously unreported N-methyl-4-hydroxy-3,5-disubstituted-2-pyridinone analogues, funiculosins B-F (1-5), along with the known compound funiculosin (6) were isolated by bioassay-guided fractionation from Talaromyces cecidicola J-4. Their structures were established by extensive spectroscopic analysis. The absolute configurations were tentatively assigned based on biogenetic considerations and electronic circular dichroism calculations. The availability of these compounds enabled a subsequent small antifungal structure-activity relationship study that revealed tetrahydroxycyclopentyl substitution as a key modulator of bioactivity. Compounds 3 and 6 exhibited pronounced inhibitory activity against human pathogenic fungi Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans with MIC values of 3.13 and 12.5 µg/mL, respectively. Moderate activity was observed with 1 and 2 against C. neoformanse and C. albicans, whereas 4 and 5 showed only negligible antifungal activity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that gut dysbacteriosis may promote the onset of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the relationship between consumption of live microorganisms and CKD remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the association between dietary consumption of live microorganisms and risk of CKD. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) spanning 2001 to 2018. Dietary intake was assessed through self-reported questionnaires, while CKD diagnosis was based on glomerular filtration rate and albumin-creatinine ratio measurements. RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders, participants with high live microbial intake had a significantly lower risk of CKD compared to those with low intake [odds ratio (OR): 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.68-0.91,  CONCLUSIONS: High dietary intake of live microorganisms is associated with a lower risk of CKD, highlighting the potential role of gut microbiota modulation in CKD prevention.

AB  - Fungal infections caused by pathogenic fungi, particularly Candida albicans, range from oral thrush to severe systemic infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals. To address this, we employed a single-step reaction procedure to esterify methyl gallate (MG) and ethyl gallate (EG), isolated from the EtOAc-soluble fraction of the hydromethanolic leaf extract of Vachellia nilotica L. (Fabaceae), using substituted benzoyl chlorides. The structures of the synthesized ester analogs (MG1-MG4 and EG1-EG4) were characterized using UV, FT-IR, NMR, and mass spectrometry. Among them, MG1 showed the highest C. albicans inhibition (83.8%). Molecular docking analysis against C. albicans 14α-demethylase (CaCYP51) revealed a binding free energy (∆G

AB  - Uncontrolled breeding and improper management of pet cats and dogs have led to the spread of zoonotic Microsporum canis (M. canis) infection, which poses challenges to clinical medication. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore and discover potential fungicides against M. canis. In this study, licochalcone A (LicoA) was prepared by a green and efficient deep eutectic solvent method based on ultrasonic assisted extraction (DES-UAE). The DES-UAE process with choline chloride and propionic acid as solvent was optimized by response surface method with the extraction amount of LicoA as the objective. Following separation and purification, the purity of LicoA reached 99.79 %. Additionally, LicoA demonstrated significant antifungal activity against M. canis with MIC of 4 μg/mL. LicoA inhibited the synthesis of ergosterol in the fungal membrane, destroy the integrity of the cell membrane, lead to the increase of membrane permeability, the release of intracellular electrolytes, the leakage of nucleic acids and proteins, and affect the normal growth of hyphae. ATPase activity was reduced, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was reduced, resulting in increased levels of ROS, which eventually induced apoptosis in M. canis. Further transcriptome analysis revealed that LicoA treatment affected "cell integrity", "energy metabolism", and "oxidative stress" metabolic pathways in M. canis, including cell wall synthesis, ergosterol synthesis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, electron transport chain, and ribosome metabolism, leading to fungal cell apoptosis. These studies establish an efficient method for LicoA extraction and provide a basis for its use as a novel antifungal agent for the treatment of dermatophytosis.

AB  - Current treatments against Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), such as vancomycin and metronidazole, frequently lead to severe recurrence due to disruption of gut microbiota balance, which results in a pressing need for new chemical entities to treat CDI. Bile acids, such as UDCA, have been demonstrated to inhibit the growth and spore germination of C. difficile, and regulate the structure of the intestinal flora. This study involved the synthesis of eight bile acid-metronidazole hybrids. Among them, the most promising hybrid, SCUT1-2, effectively killed the vegetative cells of C. difficile with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.06-0.50 μg/mL, and inhibited spore germination in vitro. The absolute bioavailability of SCUT1-2 (F = 56.8 %) indicated that approximately half of SCUT1-2 was absorbed systemically, while a considerable portion remained in the gastrointestinal tract in its original form, laying a solid foundation for its effective action in vivo. SCUT1-2 could effectively alleviate the symptoms of weight loss and diarrhea in mice caused by CDI and effectively reduce the relevant expressions of inflammatory factors, outperforming metronidazole. Furthermore, SCUT1-2 demonstrated a favorable therapeutic effect in reducing mortality and disease symptoms in CDI mice by killing C. difficile cells and regulating the composition and structure of the intestinal flora. Notably, SCUT1-2 could effectively prevent recurrent CDI. This work provides a potential clinical lead for the development of CDI therapies and highlights hybrid medication as a new strategy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dyslipidemia is a critical risk factor for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events, necessitating effective long-term management. However, conventional lipid-lowering drugs such as statins and fibrates are limited by adverse effects, including hepatotoxicity and myopathy, which restrict their prolonged use. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and natural health products offer potential alternatives with multi-target mechanisms and improved safety profiles. Tangerine Peel Enzyme Drink (CPJS), a fermented health product derived from tangerine peel, has demonstrated lipid-modulating properties. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CPJS in improving dyslipidemia and explore its underlying metabolic and microbiological mechanisms. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled clinical trial was conducted with 72 participants (55 completers). Participants were divided into CPJS and control groups, receiving an 8-week intervention. Primary outcomes included changes in body weight and serum triglycerides (TG), while safety was assessed via liver/kidney function, creatine kinase, blood, and urine tests. Serum metabolomics (93 differential metabolites identified) and intestinal microbiota analysis were performed to elucidate metabolic pathways and microbial shifts. KEGG enrichment analysis mapped metabolites to biological pathways, such as lipid and amino acid metabolism. RESULTS: The CPJS group exhibited significant reductions in body weight and TG levels post-intervention (p < 0.05), with no adverse effects observed in safety biomarkers. Metabolomic profiling revealed alterations in fatty acyl, glycerophospholipid, and organic acid metabolites, indicating CPJS modulates lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. KEGG analysis linked these changes to pathways including triglyceride degradation and amino acid metabolism. Additionally, CPJS increased specific gut microbial taxa associated with lipid regulation, suggesting a microbiome-mediated mechanism. DISCUSSION: CPJS demonstrates efficacy in improving dyslipidemia through dual mechanisms: direct modulation of triglyceride metabolism and indirect regulation via gut microbiota. Its safety profile aligns with findings from natural products like Cyclocarya paliurus and tempeh, which mitigate lipid abnormalities without hepatotoxicity. The multi-target action of CPJS mirrors TCM principles, where compounds like quercetin and flavonoids in CPJS may synergistically inhibit cholesterol synthesis and enhance lipid clearance. However, further research is needed to isolate active components and validate microbial contributions. Compared to synthetic drugs, CPJS offers a safer adjunct therapy, addressing limitations of current pharmacotherapies. Future studies should explore dose-response relationships and long-term outcomes in diverse populations.

AB  - Chemical investigation of Disynaphia filifolia (Hassl.) R.M. King & H. Rob. (Asteraceae) led to the isolation of eight compounds, with tremetone being the major metabolite recovered. Tremetone has been suggested as the toxic compound in Ageratina altissima and Isocoma pluriflora, two species of the Asteraceae family. Although D. filifolia is not classified as a toxic species, tremetone was identified as the major compound in the crude extract of this species, constituting approximately 21% of the total content. Furthermore, 22 compounds were annotated using dereplication techniques, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry, and a molecular networking approach. Antiproliferative assays indicated that tremetone was weakly active against the human tumor cell lines tested, proving to be even more toxic to non-tumor cells compared to tumor cell lines. Moreover, the potential antioxidant and antibacterial activities of the crude extract and fractions of D. filifolia are reported herein.

In this study, we identify and elucidate the structure of a new quinovosamycin analogue, quinovosamycin Q4 (4), which displays potent activity against Cryptococcus neoformans (0.03 μg/mL), Candida albicans (0.5 μg/mL), and Bacillus subtilis (0.125 μg/mL). Bioinformatics analysis of the sequenced genome of the quinovosamycin producing Streptomyces strain PR-3G identified a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC), encoding all of the enzymes needed for tunicamycin synthesis, as well as several new upstream genes likely responsible for synthesis and incorporation of the alternative N-acetylquinovosamine sugar needed for quinovosamycin production. The role of the upstream genes in quinovosamycins biosynthesis was confirmed by insertional mutagenesis.

AB  - In order to contribute to the fight against the antibiotic resistance crisis, we used a dual-activity prospection strategy for natural product mixtures with antibiotic resistance modulating and antibacterial activities in the essential oils (EOs) of Artemisia ludoviciana, Lippia graveolens, and Cosmos bipinnatus against multidrug-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa HIM-MR01, Staphylococcus aureus HIM-MR02, Enterococcus faecalis HIM-MR05, and Salmonella typhi HIM-MR06. The three EOs exerted antibacterial activity on the bacterial strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 0.1735 to 65.6263 µg/mL. When combined with antibiotics, the L. graveolens EO showed the highest resistance modulation for vancomycin (VA), nalidixic acid (NA), and chloramphenicol against S. aureus (MIC: 0.0347 µg/mL), E. faecalis (MIC: 0.0832 µg/mL), and P. aeruginosa (MIC: 0.0694 µg/mL). For the A. ludoviciana EO, resistance modulation was based on S. aureus-VA (MIC: 0.6525 µg/mL) and E. faecalis-NA (MIC: 0.3262 µg/mL). Thereby, C. bipinnatus EO did not show significant antibiotic resistance modulating activity. In conclusion, L. graveolens and A. ludoviciana EOs showed antibacterial activity and the greatest potential in inhibiting bacterial resistance to antibiotics. The dual activity of these EOs makes them a promising adjuvant in the treatment of diseases caused by multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria.

AB  - This study explores the potential of Thymus ciliatus as a natural source of bioactive compounds by investigating its chemical composition and in vitro biological activities, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, and anti-Alzheimer properties. The analysis of the essential oil was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealing α-terpinenyl acetate (18.74%) and camphor (10.62%) as the major components. Antioxidant activity was evaluated using six methods. Antimicrobial activity was assessed using disc diffusion and well diffusion techniques. Antidiabetic activity was measured through a colorimetric assay, while anti-Alzheimer activity was evaluated against butyrylcholinesterase. The results demonstrated that extracts from polar and medium-polar solvents exhibited the highest antioxidant activity, followed by low-polar solvent extracts. The essential oil of T. ciliatus displayed significant antimicrobial activity, particularly against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Candida albicans. Crude extracts also showed antimicrobial activity across all tested strains. The aqueous extract exhibited the strongest antidiabetic activity against α-glucosidase (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC

AB  - Acute respiratory diseases in humans can be caused by various viral pathogens such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human coronavirus 229E (hCoV-229E), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To prevent severe cases by an early treatment, one effective strategy is to inhibit viral infection at the entry stage of the replication cycle. However, there is a lack of efficient, FDA-approved small-molecule drugs targeting these pathogens. Previously, we identified two dual RSV/hCoV-229E small-molecule inhibitors with activity in the single-digit micromolar range. In this study, we focused on a structure-guided optimization approach of the more promising prototype addressing activity, cell viability, selectivity, solubility and metabolic stability. We present valuable insights into the structure-activity relationship (SAR), and report the discovery of a sub-micromolar RSV entry inhibitor, a dual RSV/CoV-229E inhibitor and a highly potent compound against hCoV-229E.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the frequency of multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MDR) found in patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) and to analyze the antibiotic resistance patterns in these patients. Additionally, Selenium nanoparticles (Se-NPs) were synthesized using eco-friendly methods and conjugated with antibacterial proteins (7S and 11S globulins) from red kidney beans to enhance their antibacterial properties. The highest percentages of resistance were found for Amikacin (AK; 43 %), Cefuroxime (CXM; 42 %), Gatifloxacin (GAT; 38 %), Clindamycin (DA; 38 %), Ciprofloxacin (CIP; 36 %), Ceftriaxone (CRO; 35 %), Cefoperazone/Sulbactam (CES; 34 %), Nitrofurantoin (F; 31 %), Piperacillin (PRL; 26 %), and Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid (AMC; 23 %). The 10 bacterial isolates resistant to more than or equal to 80 % of selected antibiotics were chosen and then identified. All ten isolates were confirmed to be Acinetobacter spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, and E. coli. The synthesis of Se-NPs was indicated by colour changes to ruby red and are preliminary substantiated by UV-Vis spectrum high peak absorption spectrum at 388 nm for Se-NPs, while the conjugated Se-NPs with 7S protein were 400 nm as well as Se-NPs with 11S protein were 420 nm. The TEM and DLS confirmed the formation of selenium nanoparticles of several sizes. Results showed that 11S globulin had the highest antibacterial activity of 7S globulin and isolated protein, recording the MIC at 125 μg/mL. Conjugation between Se-NPs with antibacterial proteins (protein isolates, 7S, and 11S) has MBC (125 μg/mL) and MIC (125 μg/mL) values against tested bacteria.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Scientific information on the diets of various nutritional planes supplemented with organic acids is scarce in tropical environments. OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to evaluate the response of broilers to diets of different nutritional planes supplemented with or without organic acids. A total of 240 one-day-old unsexed broiler chicks of the Cobb 500 strain were randomly assigned to 6 treatments, each with 4 replicates having 10 chicks. METHODS: The treatments were chickens fed an optimal diet (optimal energy and protein) (Diet 1), a medium diet (medium energy and protein) (Diet 2) and a low diet (low energy and protein) (Diet 3), while diets 4, 5 and 6 were diets 1, 2 and 3 supplemented with 4, 6 and 8 g/kg organic acid (Fysal-MP), respectively. The study was laid out in a completely randomized design. RESULTS: The birds fed diets with organic acid supplementation recorded similar (p > 0.05) final weights compared to those fed an optimal diet (T1); however, the weights were higher (p < 0.05) compared to the chickens on a low diet without organic acid (T3). The feed conversion ratio was better in birds fed diets containing organic acid, irrespective of the nutritional plane. Birds on medium diets with organic acids recorded a higher (p < 0.05) aspartate aminotransferase compared to those on low diets during the starter phase. Birds on a low diet without organic acid recorded a lower (p < 0.05) basal width compared to those on other diets. The microbial counts were reduced (p < 0.05) in broilers fed organic acids, with the lowest reduction in the group fed medium diets with 6 g/kg organic acids. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that organic acid supplementation enhanced blood parameters, carcass traits, growth performance and microbial counts in broiler chickens.

AB  - This study investigated the chemical composition and biological activity of essential oil (EO) extracted from the leaves of Oudneya africana from Ouargla, using gas chromatography-flame ionization detector/mass spectrometry. A total of 35 compounds were identified, representing 87.45% of the oil composition, with hexacosane (34.94%), 2-pentadecanone-6,10,14-trimethyl (4.86%), and hexadecanoic acid methyl ester (3.45%) as major components. The EO demonstrated significant antimicrobial resistance against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, notably inhibiting Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli growth (inhibition zones: 30.5 ± 1 mm (34.44%) and 28.5 ± 1 mm (32.22%), respectively), while showing minimal effect on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, it's also exhibited strong antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger at minimum concentration of 25 mg/mL. Additionally, the EO displayed dose-dependent anti-diabetic potential through alpha-amylase inhibition, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration value of 341.12 ± 1.14 µg/mL. However, its sun protection factor (SPF) was relatively low 8.96 ± 0.06. This is the first report on the α-amylase, antifungal, and SPF properties of O. africana EO, highlighting its potential as a source of natural compounds for medical application.

AB  - The rise of multidrug resistance (MDR) in pathogens presents a significant challenge to global health, particularly in poultry industries. This study explores the antibacterial efficacy of silver nanoparticles (WcAgNPs) synthesized from Withania coagulans fruit extract against MDR Salmonella sp. and Escherichia coli. Phytochemical analysis of the fruit extract revealed a rich profile, including tannins, phenols, steroids, and terpenoids. Central composite design and response surface methodology (RSM) were utilized to optimize the synthesis parameters at pH 9, temperature 60°C, incubation for 24 h, wavelength 400 nm, and silver nitrate concentration of 3 mM. Characterization of WcAgNPs through FTIR, zeta sizer, SEM, EDX, and XRD confirmed their spherical shape, crystalline structure, and average size of 232.8 nm with a high silver content of 95.64%. Antibacterial tests showed significant inhibition, with zones of 26 mm against Salmonella sp. and 37 mm against E. coli. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were 0.04 mg/µL for Salmonella sp. and 0.002 mg/µL for E. coli. These findings highlight WcAgNPs as a promising therapeutic agent for controlling poultry infections. Future research should focus on in vivo trials to confirm their safety and efficacy. Successful application of WcAgNPs could revolutionize poultry health management, providing effective alternatives to traditional antibiotics and advancing sustainable farming practices.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) remains a global public health threat, particularly due to dormant Mtb, which necessitates prolonged drug treatment. Mycobacterium tuberculosis malate synthase (MtbMS) is a key rate-limiting enzyme in the glyoxylate shunt, essential for the survival of dormant Mtb but absent in the host. Using target-based virtual screening and biochemical approaches, we identified novel natural inhibitors of MtbMS. Molecular docking by Schrödinger and subsequent manual selection identified 11 compounds as potential inhibitors. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and binding-free energy analysis (MM/GBSA) demonstrated high stability and binding affinity of MtbMS with Nordihydroguaiaretic Acids (NDGA) and Meso-NDGA. NDGA and Meso-NDGA by inhibition experiment exhibited half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC

AB  - The design of new antimicrobial agents is an important challenge due to the growing resistance of microorganisms to existing antibiotics. In recent years, the trend towards the development of compounds and materials with (bio)degradable properties has emerged. In this work, we propose and develop a method for the synthesis of new peptidomimetics, i.e., water-soluble macrocyclic quaternary ammonium salts containing L-tyrosine fragments based on p-tert-butylthiacalix[4]arene in various stereoisomeric forms (cone, partial cone, and 1,3-alternate).

AB  - Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a leading cause of chronic hepatitis and remains a significant global public health concern due to the lack of effective treatments. HBV replicates through reverse transcription within the viral capsid, making capsid assembly a promising antiviral target. However, no approved therapies currently target this process. In our previous study, we optimized the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of NVR 3-778 by modifying the A and B rings, leading to the identification of KR-26556 and Compound 3. In this study, we further synthesized derivatives to modify the C ring, resulting in the discovery of KR019 and KR026. These compounds exhibited over 170-fold higher selectivity than the reference compound while demonstrating potent antiviral activity in HBV-replicating cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that KR019 binds to the hydrophobic pocket at the core protein dimer-dimer interface, misdirecting capsid assembly into genome-free capsids and thereby inhibiting viral replication. Additionally, pharmacokinetic profiling confirmed favorable stability and safety. These findings highlight the strong antiviral potential of KR019 and KR026 and provide a foundation for further in vivo investigation.

AB  - The rise of antimicrobial resistance necessitates the development of novel therapeutic agents. This study presents the design, in silico studies, synthesis, and biological evaluation of Schiff-base isoxazole hybrids as potential antimicrobial agents. Computational approaches, including molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and ADMET predictions, guided the design and assessment of these compounds. DFT analysis identified compound A20 (-0.0919 Hartree) as having the lowest energy gap, suggesting high reactivity. Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities (-11.3 to -7.00 kcal/mol) comparable to standard antimicrobial drugs, while MD simulations confirmed the stability of protein-ligand interactions. ADMET analysis predicted favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Biological evaluations revealed promising antimicrobial potential of the synthesized compounds. A20 showed significant antifungal activity (MIC: 64 μg/mL), while A7 exhibited notable antibacterial activity (MIC: 1024 μg/mL). Further A20 in combination with standard antifungal drug fluconazole is exhibiting outstanding antifungal potential. Leading towards the possibility of developing a new drug against resistant microbial strains through combination therapy.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Ticks transmit severe human and animal diseases, posing global health and economic risks.  OBSERVATIONS: Several novel antigens target essential physiological processes for tick survival. Reproductive and developmental antigens, such as subolesin and subolesin+cystatin, regulate immunity and reproduction, reducing blood feeding, oviposition, egg mass, and hatching rates. Knockdown of recombinant P27/30 impairs embryogenesis, significantly reducing larval survival. Chitinase inhibition disrupts molting, impairing nymph development. Metabolic enzymes like enolase and GSK-3β regulate homeostasis and energy production; their inhibition reduces feeding efficiency and survivability. Additionally, ribosomal protein S27 and troponin I-like protein, essential for protein synthesis and muscle contraction, respectively, impact tick growth and mobility. These antigens may serve as valuable vaccine targets for controlling  CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Anti-tick vaccines offer a cost-effective, sustainable alternative to chemical controls. Advances in transcriptomics, genomics, and proteomics have identified promising antigens, with subolesin, chitinase, troponin I-like protein, GSK-3β, and enolase demonstrating strong potential. Enolase, affecting immunity, reproduction, and pathogen transmission, emerges as the most effective target for reducing

AB  - Cooling towers are critical engineered water systems for air conditioning and refrigeration but can create favorable conditions for Legionella pneumophila growth and aerosolization. Human exposure to L. pneumophila-contaminated aerosols can cause Legionnaire's disease. Routine monitoring of L. pneumophila in cooling towers offers possibilities to develop quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) models to guide system design, operation, control, and maintenance. Here, we used the regulatory monitoring database from Quebec, Canada, to develop statistical models for predicting L. pneumophila concentration variability in cooling towers and integrate these models into a screening-level QMRA model to predict human health risks. Analysis of 105,463 monthly L. pneumophila test results revealed that the exceedance rate of the 10

AB  - The rise of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) strains has emerged as an increasing threat to global public health. The development of antibiotic adjuvants presents an economical and promising approach to address this crisis. Through a high-throughput screen of the FDA-approved compound library, we identified tavaborole (AN2690) as a broad-spectrum β-lactamase inhibitor. The mechanistic study revealed that tavaborole formed a reversible binding with the active serine of KPC-2, showing effective competitive inhibition. Its electron-deficient boron atom formed a borate ester bond with hydroxyl group of the serine residue at the active site of KPC-2, transitioning to an sp3-hybridized state that mimicked the tetrahedral intermediate during KPC-2 catalytic. Moreover, transcriptomic analysis and bacterial metabolism assays further unveiled tavaborole addition can inhibit tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, coupled with downregulation of intracellular ATP levels, indicating that tavaborole compromised the bacterial metabolic homeostasis and exerted synergistic antibacterial activity. Notably, the combination treatment further suppressed the development of meropenem resistance. In mouse intraperitoneal infection models, tavaborole effectively restored the efficacy of meropenem against CRE bacteria. These findings elucidate the synergistic mechanisms of tavaborole, expand its potential applications in anti-infection therapeutics, and provide a promising strategy for addressing CRE infections.

AB  - Protozoal pathogens Trichomonas vaginalis and Tritrichomonas foetus are the causative agents of sexually transmitted diseases like trichomoniasis among humans and cattle, respectively. Metronidazole (a nitroimidazole-based entity) has been used as the preferred drug to treat protozoal infections for the past few years. However, the emergence of resistance has prompted researchers to further explore the nitroimidazole core to overcome its limitations while improving efficacy. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a series of nitroimidazole derivatives and nitroimidazole-7-chloroquinoline hybrids, along with their preliminary screening against different strains of T. vaginalis and T. foetus. Most compounds showed moderate to good activities, with two of the most active compounds exhibiting minimum inhibitory concentrations (IC

The antibacterial activity of these compounds was evaluated by comparing the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) with ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae using resazurin dye. The docking study showed a higher binding affinity for the synthesized compounds than sirtuin inhibitors AGK2 and selisistat against the sirtuin2 isoform. In addition, the molecular dynamics study showed good stability of the compound with the higher docking score in complex with sirtuin2 over 100 ns.

AB  - Yulania biondii contains diverse bioactive compounds with significant application potential in the pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetics industries. This study investigates the bioactivity and composition of extracts from Y. biondii. It gives us a way to think about how to use forestry waste resources in a more complete way. Extracts from Y. biondii branches, leaves, and fruits were obtained using solvents such as water, ethanol, and acetone. The chemical components were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and high-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF-MS). The antimicrobial activity of the extracts was assessed using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method, whereas antioxidant capacity was evaluated using DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging assays. Antitumor activity against HeLa, K562, SGC-7901, MCF-7, and HepG2 cells was assessed using the MTT assay. The results indicate that Y. biondii extracts contain a high content of flavonoids, alkaloids, phenolic compounds, and organic acids, with the ethanol extract showing the highest proportion of bioactive components at 64.93%. Additionally, Y. biondii extracts exhibited antioxidant, antibacterial, and antitumor properties, with particularly strong antioxidant effects that increased with higher extract concentrations. Among the extraction parts, the branch extract demonstrated the strongest antioxidant capacity, followed by the fruit extract, with the leaf extract showing the lowest capacity. Regarding antibacterial activity, the ethanol and acetone extracts from leaves and branches displayed strong inhibitory effects against Gram-positive bacteria. The ethanol extract from branches showed the strongest inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus, whereas the acetone extract from leaves exhibited the best inhibition against Bacillus cereus. Both ethanol and water extracts displayed varying levels of inhibition against five common tumor cell lines, with the antitumor activity ranked as follows, from strongest to weakest: leukemia cells, human gastric cancer cells, cervical cancer cells, human liver cancer cells, and human breast cancer cells. Notably, the water extract from Y. biondii leaves exhibited the strongest inhibition against human gastric cancer cells, with an inhibition rate of 82.49%. This study revealed the compositional characteristics of Y. biondii extracts and preliminarily evaluated their potential in antibacterial, antioxidant, and antitumor applications, providing a theoretical reference for the further development and application of natural plant extracts.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of increasing levels of benzoic acid (BA) on nitrogen utilization and metabolism affecting growth performance, ammonia emissions, and carcass characteristics, and to determine the optimal levels of BA for the growth performance and carcass characteristics when fed to pigs from weaning to market. A total of 480 pigs (6.0 ± 1.5 kg) were assigned to 4 dietary treatments in a randomized complete block design with initial body weight and group as blocks and were fed in 6 phases. Treatments included a basal diet with antibiotics (positive control, PC) and diets with 3 levels of BA (0.00%, 0.50%, and 1.00% BA) without antibiotics. The PC increased (P < 0.05) the average daily gain (ADG) and G:F during the overall period compared to no BA supplementation. Increasing levels of BA increased (P < 0.05) overall ADG quadratically (maximum at 0.53% or 7.5 g/d of BA). Increasing levels of BA increased (P < 0.05) overall G:F quadratically (maximum at 0.57% or 8.1 g/d of BA). Increasing levels of BA tended to increase (linear, P = 0.096) N digestibility and increased (linear, P < 0.05) N retention. The BA supplementation at 1.00% decreased (P < 0.05) urine pH and aerial ammonia emission from manure compared to no BA supplementation in the 24 h collection period. The BA supplementation at 1.00% decreased (P < 0.05) rate of change in aerial ammonia emission compared to no BA supplementation in the 24 h collection period. The PC increased (P < 0.05) shrink weight, hot carcass weight, and first rib backfat compared to no BA supplementation. Increasing levels of BA decreased (P < 0.05) loin color and marbling score linearly and increased (P < 0.05) the loin eye area quadratically (maximum at 0.59% or 8.1 g/d of BA). In conclusion, supplementation of BA in feeds enhanced growth performance, improved N utilization, reduced urine pH, reduced aerial ammonia emissions, and improved carcass characteristics of pigs. Supplementation of BA at a range of 0.53% to 0.59% (corresponding to 7.5 to 8.1 g/d of BA based on overall average daily feed intake) provided the optimal improvements in body weight gain, feed efficiency, and carcass characteristics when fed to pigs from weaning to market.

AB  - The organophosphorus pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) is widely utilized in agriculture to protect crops from pests and diseases. Concerns regarding its extensive use have emerged due to the substance's persistence, bioaccumulation, endocrine disruption, and associated toxicity, which may lead to various adverse reactions. In this study, 32 male C57BL/6 J mice were orally administered varying doses of CPF over a period of two weeks. Metabolic perturbations resulting from subacute exposure to CPF were assessed using LC-MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomics, alongside biochemical analysis and histopathological techniques. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing method was employed to evaluate changes in the gut microbial community within the cecal contents of mice exposed to CPF. In vivo studies have shown that CPF exposure induced dose-dependent damage and dysregulation of the intestinal microbiota in mouse colonic tissues. This was characterized by significant alterations in the gut microbiota, increased intestinal permeability and elevated levels of lipopolysaccharides. These changes may have compromised intestinal barrier function and facilitated the transfer of intestinal microbial metabolites and endotoxins to the liver, subsequently leading to liver injury. Collectively, this study elucidates a potential mechanism by which CPF triggers liver injury through alterations in the intestinal microbial community and increased intestinal permeability. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the toxicological effects of CPF but also contribute to the assessment of health risks associated with CPF exposure.

AB  - In the past two decades, the use of probiotics in livestock production has significantly increased. Direct-fed microbials (DFMs) have become popular in beef cattle production due to consumer demand for more natural meat alternatives. The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate the dose-response of L28 at concentrations of 6, 7, and 8 log CFU/mL to inhibit the growth of STEC and S. enterica in cattle manure, and (2) assess tylosin and monensin in cattle manure and the efficacy of L28 in pathogen inhibition. Fecal samples were collected from cattle fed three different rations: (1) monensin and tylosin (MONTY), (2) monensin with L28 (MONPRO), and (3) no L28, tylosin or monensin (BASE). Sterilized fecal samples were inoculated with a cocktail mixture of three Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) or Salmonella enterica (S. enterica) strains to an initial concentration of 3.0-4.0 log CFU/g. To evaluate the dose-response, Lactobacillus salivarius (L. salivarius) L28 was applied at concentrations of 6, 7, and 8 log CFU/ml. For S. enterica, the (BASE) ration had a significant treatment time effect at 12 h and 24 h with L28 at a dose of 8 log CFU (p = 0.01, p = 0.03). For STECs, the (BASE) had a similar effect, however, not significant for 24 h (p = 0.7). A dose of 8 log CFU/mL reduced S. enterica growth in manure samples by 1.3-4.2 log CFU/g compared to BASE. While L. salivarius does not completely prevent bacterial growth, it effectively reduces foodborne pathogens. Using L. salivarius in beef products offers a natural alternative to antibiotics, benefiting both consumers and the beef industry.

AB  - Purine alkaloids were proven to have significant cytotoxic activity against different cancer cell lines via modulating several cellular pathways, leading to inhibition of cell proliferation and increasing cell death. The search for new potential cytotoxic compounds produced by natural eco-friendly means is of great importance. The microbial transformation of natural purine alkaloids, caffeine (Cf), theophylline (Tp), theobromine (Tb), and theacrine (Tc) via filamentous fungi was explored using Aspergillus versicolor (AUMC 4807), Aspergillus niger (NRRL 328), Cunninghamella echinulata (ATCC 1382), and Penicillium chrysogeneum (ATCC 9480). Nine metabolites were isolated via demethylation, and oxidation reactions, namely; 1.3.7-trimethyl uric acid (M1), theacrine (M2), theobromine (M3), paraxanthine (M4), theophylline (M5), 3-methylxanthine (M6), caffeine (M7), 7-methylxanthine (M8) and 3,7,9-trimethyl uric acid (M9). The structure elucidation of the metabolites was based primarily on 1D, 2D-NMR analyses and HRMS. In vitro cytotoxic activity of metabolites was evaluated against CNS (SNB-75) and melanoma (MDA-MB-435) cancer cell lines. Based on the pharmacophore and structural similarity, mTOR enzyme inhibition assay was carried out, and results were confirmed by molecular docking and molecular dynamic studies using mTOR as the target enzyme. Furthermore, the binding mode of M9 with mTOR was investigated using docking computations. The steadiness and binding affinities of compound M9 in complex with mTOR were estimated and compared to caffeine (M7) over the 100 ns MD course. Results confirmed that M9 has great potential as a cytotoxic agent with experimentally proved safety that can be produced by biotransformation.

AB  - To address the growing resistance and environmental issues of existing fungicides, the development of novel broad-spectrum fungicides based on new targets, such as TPS1, has been prioritized. However, related research remains limited. In this study, we optimized our previously reported isopropanolamine-based MoTPS1 inhibitor, j11, by replacing its groups on both sides of its isopropanolamine linker with sulfonamide and 1,2,4-triazole fragments through a fragment replacement combining rational design approach. This approach led to the identification of novel isopropanolamine compounds, including g12, g18, o1, and o3, exhibiting significantly improved TPS1 inhibition compared to j11, with IC

AB  - A novel series of benzofuran/indole-chalcone linked 1,2,3-triazole hybrids (4a-k, 8a-h) were synthesized to explore their potential as antifungal agents. Among the 19 derivatives, 4b, 4c, 4i, 4j, and 8a showed inhibition against Candida glabrata at 50 µg/mL concentration that is comparable to the control drug fluconazole. Compounds 4b, 4c, and 4j showed greater activity at low concentrations (25 and 12.5 µg/mL). Among them, 4j exhibited the highest potency, with 81.82% inhibition against C. glabrata at 50 µg/mL. Compound 4j exhibited better safety profiles against human acute monocytic leukemia cells. In structural activity studies, chloro (Cl) at the 2,6th position of the phenyl ring of chalcone and p-CN substitution on the benzyl triazole moiety maximizes the potential. In addition, in silico ADME analysis supports the drug-likeness profile and strengthens the data. So, compound 4j can be used as an effective lead to develop a potent and safer antifungal drug candidate to combat Candida infections.

AB  - Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) has emerged as a promising strategy for addressing bacterial infections, particularly those involving biofilm formation. The electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged bacterial cell walls and the cationic charges of photosensitizers facilitates the accumulation of PSs on bacterial surfaces, thereby enhancing aPDT efficacy. In this study, three series of tetracationic tetraaryltetranaphtho[2,3]porphyrins (TNPs), each incorporating different cationic groups with alkyl chains of varying lengths, were designed and synthesized. Their photodynamic inactivation efficacy against S. aureus, E. coli and C. albicans was evaluated, respectively. These TNPs exhibited strong absorption at ∼730 nm with high molar extinction coefficients (>51,500 L·mol

AB  - There is an urgent need to develop new anti-tuberculosis (anti-TB) drugs to tackle drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb). Whereas antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have received attention because of their antibacterial properties, oligo-N-substituted glycines (peptoids) are now seen as favorable alternatives to AMPs because they are more stable and less vulnerable to protease degradation, less expensive to produce, and better suited to potential pharmaceutical adoption and development. In this work, therefore, we designed, synthesized, and screened 22 new α- and β-peptoids against drug susceptible M. tb strain H37Rv using the Microplate Alamar Blue assay (MABA) to evaluate minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Eight compounds (JC5, MM2, MM5, MM9, MM10, MM11, JF11, and JF13) had MICs of less than 10 μg/ml, the most potent of which were JC5 and MM2, with MICs of 1.48 μg/ml and 2.97 μg/ml, respectively. JC5 and MM2 also retained potency against strains mono-resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, and against five of the global M. tb clade representatives. Furthermore, peptoids JC5 and MM2 showed minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 3.02 μg/ml and 5.48 μg/ml respectively. Intracellular activity by luminescence showed a macrophage EC90 of less than 10 μg/ml for both JC5 and MM2. In addition, both compounds showed remarkable narrow spectrum activity. Selectivity with respect to Vero cells was modest but sufficient to consider these classes of alpha and beta-peptoids as good leads for further development of anti-TB drugs.

AB  - The development of novel fungicides is imperative for the protection of crops and the assurance of sustainable agricultural development. A total of 33 5H-chromeno[4,3-b]pyridin-5-one derivatives have been synthesized, and the antifungal activities of these derivatives against four pathogenic fungi (Alternaria alternata, Alternaria solani, Botrytis cinerea, and Fusarium oxysporum) have been evaluated. The structure-property relationship indicated that the introduction of side-chain groups at the hydroxyl position played a significant role in the antifungal activity, with the inhibition rates increasing by 3-4 folds. The results demonstrate that compound 1i exhibits superior antifungal activity in comparison to the positive controls, osthole, and azoxystrobin. The inhibition rate of 1i against A. alternata was found to be 68.90% at a concentration of 100 µg/mL, with a median effective concentration value of 15.72 µg/mL. Additionally, the in vivo inhibition rate of 1i against A. alternata on pears was found to keep 56.4% at 400 µg/mL after 7 days, which is more effective than those of the positive controls (37.3% for azoxystrobin and 42.3% for osthole). Molecular docking based on homology modeling reveals that the compound 1i is placed in a pocket constructed from amino acid residues including Pro-380, Thr-307, Leu-305, Gln-103, Gly-104, Thr-266, His-406, Ala-101, Ala-102, Arg-451, His-98, Leu-457, and Thr-99 of succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) with the binding energy of -7.16 kcal/mol. It was suggested that the compound 1i can be considered a potential inhibitor of SDH to exhibit antifungal activity.

AB  - Arterial stiffening is an independent predictor of cardiovascular diseases, closely associated with hypertension and aging. Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease caused by microbial imbalances, has been linked to systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. This study aims to investigate the association between periodontitis and arterial stiffening in hypertensive individuals. Data utilized in this study were sourced from the 2009-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). A total of 3165 hypertensive patients aged ≥ 50 years were enrolled. The relationship between the severity of periodontitis and arterial stiffening (PP ≥ 60) was analyzed using multivariate logistic regression model. Moreover, the associations between pocket depth (PD) and clinical attachment loss (CAL) with arterial stiffening were investigated using multivariate logistic regression model and restricted cubic splines. Among the patients, 1223 (39%) exhibited no or mild periodontal disease, while 1447 (46%) and 495 (15%) were diagnosed with moderate and severe periodontal disease, respectively. Moderate and severe periodontitis were associated with higher odds of arterial stiffening compared to no/mild periodontitis in the fully adjusted model (moderate: OR 1.30 [95% CI 1.09-1.55], P = 0.004; severe: OR 1.35 [95% CI 1.05-1.73], P = 0.019; P for trend < 0.001). Higher quartiles of PD and CAL scores were significantly associated with greater odds of arterial stiffening (PD Q4 vs. Q1: OR 1.41 [95% CI 1.12-1.79], P = 0.004; CAL Q4 vs. Q1: 1.31 [95% CI 1.03-1.67], P = 0.030), with evidence of linear dose-response relationships (P

AB  - In the past decade, several quantitative models and risk assessments for Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and Listeria monocytogenes have been developed to guide the management of these pathogens in fresh produce. However, there is a need to collect and critically review the parameters used to guide their potential reuse in future risk assessments. This review (i) identifies 11 and 7 recently published quantitative models and risk assessments for STEC and L. monocytogenes, respectively, in leafy greens, (ii) summarizes parameters, and (iii) reviews the underlying data sources or mathematical formulas used. A total of 70 unique key parameters (55 and 25 for STEC and L. monocytogenes, respectively, 10 shared) were extracted from the reviewed models across five supply chain stages, including: Preharvest, Harvest, Processing, Presentation to Consumer (Retail or Foodservice Locations), and Consumer Handling. Primary growth, secondary growth, and dose-response equations and parameters for STEC and L. monocytogenes were also extracted. Additional literature reviews were performed if (i) certain key parameters were based on a single or a few data sources or (ii) key parameters were identified in a supply chain stage for one pathogen, but missing from the other. The critical summaries of parameters presented here (i) provide a resource for future risk assessments, (ii) help define future data collection needs, and (iii) represent a starting point for similar reviews focusing on other produce commodities and pathogens.

AB  - Biopreservation and post-lethality treatments (PLT) are the basis of operating procedures applied to reduce the levels of Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat food. The combination of these strategies must be wisely selected, and their interaction should be considered in quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRA) assessing the listeriosis risk. The aim of the present study was to develop a QMRA model to assess the impact of intervention strategies, including formulation with lactate, bioprotective cultures and the use of high-pressure processing (HPP), on reducing the listeriosis risk associated to the consumption of cooked meat products by elderly populations. Particularly, the interaction between the formulation with lactate and the application of HPP was addressed as lactate is reported to exert (i) a piezo-protection on L. monocytogenes inactivation by HPP and (ii) a piezo-stimulation effect on the growth rate of survivors. Results showed that the reduction of product's shelf-life or the use of biopreservation strategies (lactate and bioprotective cultures) were more effective in reducing the listeriosis risk than mild HPP treatments. Moreover, the application of a mild HPP treatment in combination with the formulation with lactate did not result in a higher risk reduction compared to the formulation of lactate alone. On the other hand, the application of a 5-log PLT was more effective for risk reduction compared to other strategies. The results provided in this work can help in the design of measures to control L. monocytogenes that have the desired impact on risk of reduction.

AB  - Currently, there are no clinically approved antiviral agents against dengue-virus (DENV). This study aimed to determine the prophylactic, antiviral, and therapeutic potential of quercetin by its pre-treatment, co-treatment, and post-treatment [24, 48, and 72 h-post-infection (HPI)] of DENV-infected Balb/C mice through both oral and intraperitoneal (I.P) route, respectively. 80 mg/kg/day and 16 mg/kg/day of quercetin were non-toxic for oral and I.P administration, respectively. I.P. was found to be more effective than oral administration which significantly reduced DENV copy-number in co-treatment group (from day 1, p < 0.01); post-treatment (24hpi),and pretreatment groups (day 3 onwards, p < 0.05). Molecular-docking experiments indicated quercetin could act as a double-edged sword by strongly interacting with DENV envelope-glycoprotein (-8.1 kcal/mol) and NS5-RdRp domain (-8.0 kcal/mol), which are crucial for viral-attachment and replication. MD-simulation of docked complexes indicated their stability defined by low RMSD, RMSF, and stable H-bond with active-site residues. Significant reduction (p < 0.001) in TNF-α, IL-6, ROS-production, and vascular leakage was observed among pre-, co-, and post-treatment (24 and 48 HPI) groups with promising hepatic and renal-protective effects. Pharmacological and functional-molecular interaction networks indicate a significant effect of quercetin on vascular integrity byVEGF-KDR signaling pathway (via PI3K-Akt and Ras signalling), oxygen homeostasis through HIF-1 signalling, and the anti-inflammatory response via PI3K-Akt, IL-6 and its receptor signalling (PPI enrichment P = 3.19e-10).Thus, it can be concluded that I.P. co- and post-treatment (24hpi) of quercetin to DENV-infected mice could effectively reduce viral-titer, pro-inflammatory cytokines, ROS-response, and vascular permeability. Taken together this demonstrates quercetin as an important antiviral candidate against dengue.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains one of the leading causes of death among infectious diseases. Enhancing the ability of anti-tuberculosis drugs to eradicate Mycobacterium tuberculosis within host cells remains a significant challenge. METHODS: A mannosamine-modified nanoparticle delivery system was developed using poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) copolymers to enhance the targeted delivery of rifapentine (RPT) to macrophages. D-mannosamine was conjugated to PLGA-polyethylene glycol (PLGA-PEG) copolymers through EDC/NHS coupling chemistry, and the resultant RPT-MAN-PLGA-PEG nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared through a combination of phacoemulsification and solvent evaporation methods. The physicochemical properties, toxicity, in vitro drug release profiles, stability, cellular uptake, and anti-TB efficacy of the NPs were systematically evaluated. RESULTS: The RPT-MAN-PLGA-PEG NPs had a mean particle size of 108.2 ± 7.2 nm, with encapsulation efficiency and drug loading rates of 81.2 ± 6.3% and 13.7 ± 0.7%, respectively. RPT release from the NPs was sustained for over 60 hours. Notably, the phagocytic uptake of the MAN-PLGA NPs by macrophages was significantly higher compared to PLGA-PEG NPs. Both NPs improved pharmacokinetic parameters without inducing significant organ toxicity. The minimum inhibitory concentration for the NPs was 0.047 μg/mL, compared to 0.2 μg/mL for free RPT. CONCLUSION: The engineered RPT-MAN-PLGA-PEG NPs effectively enhanced macrophage uptake in vitro and facilitated the intracellular clearance of Mtb. This nanoparticle-based delivery system offers a promising approach for improving the precision of anti-TB therapy, extending drug release, optimizing pharmacokinetic profiles, augmenting antimicrobial efficacy, and mitigating drug-related toxicities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heterocyclic compounds are prevalent in nature and essential to life. The synthesis and application of medium-sized ring heterocyclic compounds have gained prominence. Pyranopyrazole is one such compound that has a significant impact on biological and medicinal chemistry. It has attracted interest in agrochemical research due to its fungicidal, bactericidal, and herbicidal properties. Additionally, it exhibits various biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anticancer, and antimalarial effects. Furthermore, it has been explored for its potential in treating SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE: The study synthesized novel pyranopyrazole compounds and evaluated their anticancer efficacy against certain tumor cell lines (MCF-7, HeLa, and PC-3) and antimicrobial activities as deduced through molecular docking studies. METHODS: A one-pot, four-component reaction involving ethyl acetoacetate (1), hydrazine hydrate (2), malononitrile or ethyl cyanoacetate (3a, b), and aromatic aldehydes (4a-c) in an ethanolic/piperidine solution was conducted, yielding pyranopyrazoles (5a-f) in moderate to good yields. RESULTS: This study involved the synthesis of novel pyranopyrazole derivatives 5a-f and the evaluation of their anticancer and antimicrobial activities. These findings indicate that compound 5f is extremely active. It is more potent than 5-fluorourcail and ofloxacin, and it may also have new modes of action that are worth more research, while compound 5d has the highest antimicrobial activity. Molecular docking studies help us learn more about how these chemicals interact with biological targets like the TGF-βI receptor and the choline-binding domain, both of which play a key role in the growth of cancer. CONCLUSION: A series of novel pyranopyrazole derivatives 5a-f were synthesized and analyzed using spectral data. Compound 5f stands out as a lead molecule for more study and improvement due to its low IC50 value and high binding affinity. Based on how stable it is in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and how its anticancer properties are linked to its binding affinities, it may be a strong TGF-βI receptor inhibitor.

AB  - Infections caused by Candida species are on the rise, and the escalating concern revolves around the growing resistance to known antifungals, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. The essential oils (EOs) of thyme, oregano, and savory were studied for antifungal, antibiofilm, and potential synergistic activity against isolates of Candida. The oils underwent chemical characterization, revealing comparable compositions of the monoterpene phenols, predominantly thymol and carvacrol, albeit in varying proportions. Anti-Candida activity assessments of these EOs and the type of interactions among these agents on planktonic cells of candidal isolates were done by microdilution and the checkerboard method, respectively. Our findings underscore the significant inhibitory effects of the tested agents against both planktonic and biofilm forms of Candida cells. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the tested oils against planktonic Candida cells ranged from 0.312 to 2.500 mg/mL, classifying them as highly to moderately active against the causative agents of candidosis. The effect on the formation of Candida biofilms was statistically significant for the majority of the tested candidal isolates, with a reduction percentage greater than 50%. Notably, the high significance of our study lies in the presented synergistic effects observed in the majority of the examined combinations, without any presence of antagonistic interactions.

AB  - Growing concern over environmental contaminants, including pharmaceuticals and antifungal agents, highlights their role in promoting resistance and biofilm formation by microorganisms. Antifungal resistance, especially in drug-resistant Candida spp., poses a global threat, worsened by the widespread use of antifungal agents in both clinical applications and environmental contamination. This study investigates the antibiofilm properties of various halogenated pyrrolo pyrimidine derivatives, specifically 4-chloro-5-iodo-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (10) and 2,4-dichloro-5-iodo-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (16), against fluconazole-resistant C. albicans. Both compounds demonstrated strong biofilm inhibition, with 16 showing greater efficacy even at lower concentrations. qRT-PCR analysis revealed downregulation of key biofilm- and hyphae/germ tube-relating genes, including ALS3, HWP1, and ECE1, alongside upregulation of stress response and biofilm regulator genes such as CDR11, GST3, IFD6, UCF1, YWP1, and ZAP1, indicating complex regulatory responses to the treatments. Molecular docking analysis revealed that these compounds bind effectively to the binding cavity of the ALS3 protein, with halogen atoms playing a key role in stabilizing interaction. Compound 16 exhibited minimal cytotoxicity in Brassica rapa and Caenorhabditis elegans models, suggesting a favorable ADMET safety profile. Confocal microscopy analysis confirmed the compounds effectiveness in preventing biofilm formation when applied as biodegradable PLGA coatings on biomaterial surfaces. These findings suggest that 16 holds promise as a potent antifungal agent with reduced environmental impact, offering both efficacy and sustainability.

AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the effects of a phytochemical mixture containing full spectrum cinnamon, clove, and oregano essential oils (CCO) on the growth performance, intestinal immunity, and intestinal integrity of broilers infected with coccidiosis. In chicken macrophage cells (CMCs), inflammation was induced with 1.0 µg/mL LPS, followed by stimulating with CCO at three concentrations (1.0, 10.0, and 100 µg/mL) and measuring the gene expression levels of IL-1β and IL-8. In chicken intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), CCO was added and cultured, and the gene expression levels of occludin, ZO-1, and MUC2 were measured. In the in vivo experiment, one hundred and twenty male broiler chickens (0-day-old) were allocated into three treatment groups: (1) basal diet without infection (NC), (2) basal diet with E. maxima infection (PC), and (3) CCO at 4.5 mg/kg feed with E. maxima infection (CCO). Body weight (BW) was measured on days 0, 7, 14, 20, and 22. PC and CCO groups were orally infected with E. maxima on day 14. Jejunal samples were collected on day 22 to conduct gene expression analysis of cytokines, TJ proteins, and antioxidant enzymes. CCO significantly decreased IL-1β and IL-8 in CMCs and increased ZO-1 and MUC2 in IECs in a dose-dependent manner. In the E. maxima-infected groups, dietary CCO tended to mitigate BW loss due to infection. Upon infection, proinflammatory cytokines were suppressed in the CCO group compared to the PC group. Dietary CCO also increased the expression of occludin and JAM-2 in the jejunum. However, CCO did not reduce the oocyst number in coccidiosis-infected chickens. These results suggest that dietary CCO supplementation may improve intestinal immunity and permeability, helping to reduce productivity losses in E. maxima-infected broilers through gut physiological responses, rather than direct antimicrobial effects. These results show the advantage of using in vitro screening based on host-mediated responses, and not on direct pathogen killing, when exploring new phytochemicals to mitigate disease response to reduce economic losses due to coccidiosis.

AB  - The present study investigated the phytochemical composition of Thymus capitatus L. essential oil (TCEO) harvested in Morocco using GC-MS-MS analysis. Both in vitro and in silico approaches were combined to investigate the antioxidant, antibacterial, antidiabetic, dermatoprotective, and neuroprotective properties of TCEO as well as to identify the main compounds responsible of the promising properties. The TCEO was dominated by oxygenated monoterpene (63.33%) and monoterpene hydrocarbon (23.25%). In total, 20 volatile compounds were identified, and of them, carvacrol, thymol, p-cymene, γ-terpinene, caryophyllene, and linalool are the major compounds. Then, the study of the antioxidant activity revealed that TCEO exhibits a good activity in DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assays as the obtained values were 67.34 ± 1.54, 96.88 ± 2.76, and 99.07 ± 1.57 µg/mL, respectively, compared to those of Trolox (35.38 ± 0.91, 60.40 ± 1.55, and 52.13 ± 1.56 µg/mL, respectively). The antibacterial activity revealed that TCEO was the most active toward the two Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes) with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.125% each compared to Gram-negative ones (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) with MIC of 0.25% and 0.5%, respectively.

AB  - Environmental contamination of ready-to-eat (RTE) foods with Listeria monocytogenes is a major food safety concern. Treatment of surfaces with antimicrobial blue light (aBL) has recently emerged as a technology that can supplement current sanitation practices. Chemical sanitizers are used extensively by the food industry, but their combination with aBL at 405 nm has not been evaluated. This project was undertaken to determine the combined effect of sanitizers with aBL to inactivate L. monocytogenes dried cells on inert surfaces. Peracetic acid (PAA), benzalkonium chloride (BAC), and sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) at time/concentrations that delivered less than 2 Log CFU viability reductions were combined with limited aBL treatments applied simultaneously or sequential on cells dried on stainless steel (SS) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coupons. When five-strain mixtures were dried on SS and treated with aBL alone (575 J/cm

AB  - BACKGROUND: A previous report suggests that phytol (PHY) may exert its antidepressant effects in mice, possibly through GABA AIM: We aimed to check its antidepressant effect with possible molecular mechanisms through behavioral and in silico studies. METHODS: For this, adult mice were randomly divided into different groups (n = 6), namely control (vehicle), standards (DZP: diazepam at 2 mg/kg, FLU: flumazenil at 0.1 mg/kg, FLUX: fluoxetine at 20 mg/kg), PHY (25, 50, and 75 mg/kg), and combined groups (PHY-75 with DZP-2 and/or FLU-0.1, and FLUX-20). Thirty minutes after treatment, each animal was subjected to tail suspension and forced swimming tests, and their immobility time (IMT) was counted for 5 min. In silico studies were performed with the GABA RESULTS: The results demonstrated that PHY and/or DZP significantly (p < 0.05) and concentration-dependently inhibited GABA, while FLU alone or its combination with PHY reversed it. In mice, PHY dose-dependently reduced the IMT in both protocols, while FLUX-20 showed lower IMT compared to the control and DZP, indicating elevated locomotion in mice. It showed a reduced IMT value in male animals than in female animals. In both sexes, PHY at 75 mg/kg significantly (p < 0.05) increased the IMT values with DZP-2, while reducing this parameter with FLU-0.1. In silico studies demonstrated that PHY exhibited higher binding affinities with the α2 and α3 subunits of the GABA CONCLUSION: Taken together, PHY exerted sedative-like antidepressant effects in mice and modulated the effects of GABAergic drugs DZP and FLU and serotonergic drug FLUX. PHY may be a potential candidate for the management of depression.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between oral microbial diversity and depression symptoms in the U.S. METHODS: We utilized the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; 2009-2012) to assess the association between oral microbial diversity and depression symptoms. A cut-off PHQ-9 score of 15 was used to define severe depression symptoms. We conducted the multivariate linear regression to explore the association of the amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) with PHQ-9 scores. A restricted cubic spline (RCS) model was introduced to curve the dose-response relationship. A logistic regression model was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the association between ASVs and the risk of severe depression symptoms. Based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of beta diversity, analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) is used to assess the dissimilarity between different depression groups. RESULTS: A total of 1497 participants were included, with 111 (7.41%) meeting the criteria for severe depression. After adjusting for confounders, we found that ASVs were negatively correlated with PHQ-9 scores (β = -0.008, p = 0.014). The RCS plot showed a linear relationship (p  CONCLUSIONS: Alpha diversity of the oral microbiota was associated with a reduced risk of severe depression symptoms, which could contribute to the early identification and intervention of severe depression.

AB  - The escalating prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, coupled with the diminishing efficacy of existing antimicrobial agents, has created an urgent need for novel antibacterial therapeutics. Here, three classes of quaternized small molecule antimicrobial peptide mimics (SMAPMs) incorporating norharmane skeleton were prepared based on molecular splicing strategy. Among them, compound 10c demonstrated excellent activity against MRSA, exhibiting a low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.25 μg/mL in vitro, coupled with significant therapeutic efficacy in a murine skin infection model in vivo. Additionally, compound 10c possessed rapid bactericidal property, low tendency to induce resistance, good plasma stability, and acceptable biosafety in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that 10c exerts its multi-target antibacterial effects through several distinct pathways: (1) inhibition of biofilm formation; (2) cell wall disruption via interactions with peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acids; (3) membrane targeting characterized by depolarization, altered permeability, and structural integrity loss; (4) reduction of metabolic activity; (5) disruption of cellular redox homeostasis; and (6) DNA binding. These findings demonstrate that compound 10c has the potential to be a candidate drug, while simultaneously providing a theoretical foundation for future anti-MRSA drug development through the SMAPMs strategy.

AB  - Naegleria fowleri, known as the brain-eating amoeba, is the pathogen parasite that causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. None of the currently available therapies are fully effective, mainly due to the inefficacy of pharmacotherapy. In this regard, natural products and related compounds represent a promising strategy for amoebicidal drug discovery. Herein, a series of eight monoterpene phenol derivatives of thymol bearing ester, carbonate, or carbamate moieties were prepared, and screened as potential amoebicidal agents on N. fowleri. The cytotoxicity of these compounds on murine macrophages cell line J774 was also evaluated to assess their selectivity. Compounds 3, 4, 7 and 8 showed significant activity against the N. fowleri trophozoite. Moreover, 4-nitrophenyl thymyl carbonate 8 displayed the highest potency, showing IC

AB  - To address the challenge of antimicrobial resistance, we investigated new antibacterial peptides based on lysine- and leucine-rich sequences. We stabilised their membrane-active secondary structures by applying hydrocarbon stapling at sequence positions i and i+4. Stapling improved peptide structural stability in both aqueous and lipid environments, regardless of the staple position. It also enhanced antibacterial efficiency against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant strains, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 2-4 μM (2.5-5.5 μg/mL). The stapled peptides showed increased resistance to enzymatic degradation, particularly with staples incorporated near the N-terminus, and were not haemolytic or cytotoxic at their MICs. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed how stapling aids in (i) stabilising the membrane-active secondary structure of amphipathic peptides and (ii) accelerating their membrane insertion. Our results provide insight into peptide design for antimicrobial use. We show that hydrocarbon stapling of lysine- and leucine-rich short sequences may offer a pathway towards more stable and effective antibacterial agents.

AB  - This study aimed to synthesize novel triazino[4,3-a]quinolinecarboxylate compounds (4, 6, 8, and 10) and evaluate these compounds for their antifungal activity against Candida species. Compound 8 was a standout candidate which demonstrated superior efficacy against C. albicans (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] = 45 µg/mL), C. glabrata (MIC = 32 µg/mL), C. parapsilosis (MIC = 36 µg/mL) and C. guilliermondii (MIC = 32 µg/mL) compared to Miconazole (MIC = 50-60 µg/mL). Furthermore, the induced morphological and ultra-structural changes by compound 8 on Candida cells are analyzed by light and transmission electron microscopy. Significant alterations in the viability and the architecture of Candida cells highlight the potential of compound 8 as a lead for further use as an antifungal drug. SARs displayed that substitution with the cyano group (as in compounds 8 and 10) was critical for anticandida potency. A molecular docking study of the most active compounds 8 and 10 was conducted inside 14α-demethylase (CYP51) to predict the binding mode of these compounds as antifungal. The most active compound 8 (MIC = 32-45 µg/mL) demonstrated the highest binding energy score which is equal to -8.93 kcal/mol. The findings of the in vitro anticandidal potential have been supported by molecular docking studies.

AB  - The rise of drug resistances in malaria necessitates the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies. Targeting epigenetic pathways could open new, promising treatment avenues. In this study, the focus is on the essential Bromodomain protein 1 (PfBDP1) of the malaria pathogen Plasmodium falciparum. Utilizing the pan-selective bromodomain inhibitor MPM6, a potent initial hit is identified and it is subsequently developed into a nanomolar binder. Through a combination of virtual docking, isothermal titration calorimetry, and X-ray crystallography, the molecular interactions of the new inhibitors with the bromodomain (BRD) of the protein (PfBDP1-BRD) are elucidated. The findings include the first co-crystallized inhibitors with the structures of PfBRD1-BRD as well as the bromodomain of the close homologous protein of Plasmodium vivax (PvBDP1-BRD). The structures provide new insights into their binding mechanisms. Further validation using conditional knockdown of PfBDP1 in P. falciparum demonstrates parasite sensitivity to the inhibitor, underscoring its potential in a targeted therapeutic approach against malaria.

AB  - A total of 46 endophytic fungi were isolated from Huperzia serrata and then cultured in a standard liquid medium and PDB medium. Cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activity assays revealed that seven crude extracts exhibited significant inhibitory effects on MCF-7 and SH-SY5Y cell lines; four crude extracts effectively inhibited the growth of Candida albicans, and 12 crude extracts demonstrated potent inhibition effects on Staphylococcus aureus. Strains displaying antimicrobial activity or potential for producing novel metabolites were selected for identification. In total, 14 strains representing 7 genera were identified, 5 of which had not been previously documented regarding their secondary metabolites. A fungus, Penicillium panissanguineum SZSS 4-2-2 was preliminarily selected for further chemical investigation. From the fermentation extract of P. panissanguineum SZSS 4-2-2, one new compound (1), one new natural product (2), and two known compounds (3 and 4) were isolated. The structures of these compounds were elucidated through spectral analysis and calculated nuclear magnetic resonance and electronic circular dichroism data.

AB  - Propolis, a resin-like substance produced by bees, has previously shown antimicrobial activity against the ulcer-causing gut pathogen Helicobacter pylori. South African propolis, however, was yet to be investigated. This study aimed to investigate a comprehensive range of South African propolis for its antimicrobial activity against H. pylori and to investigate toxicity. A total of 51 samples were collected from around South Africa and comparatively analysed with three Brazilian samples. The antimicrobial broth microdilution assay was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ethanolic propolis extracts against three clinical H. pylori strains. A total of 27 South African propolis extracts presented antimicrobial activity better than that of the Brazilian samples (MIC ≤ 0.51 mg/mL). Samples with the best anti-H. pylori activity were selected for chemical analysis using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The compounds pinocembrin, 3-O-acetylpinobanksin, and pinobanksin were found to be the most abundant. All propolis extracts investigated in this study were considered non-toxic (mortality < 50%) when investigated using the brine shrimp lethality assay. This study demonstrates the in vitro potential of utilizing propolis for treating H. pylori infections and highlights the possible compounds responsible for the activity observed.

In this study, 20 novel 1,2,4-triazole-functionalized piperazine-stearic acid derivatives 6a-p were designed, synthesized, and characterized via spectroscopic analyses, evaluating their antimicrobial potential against clinically relevant bacterial and fungal strains. Notably, five derivatives (6a, 6c, 6m, 6n, and 6o) demonstrated superior antimicrobial efficacy compared to the gentamicin standard, with compound 6n showing the most potent activity (minimal inhibitory concentration = 3.125 µg/mL against Staphylococcus aureus). Molecular docking simulations further revealed strong binding affinities of these compounds to microbial target proteins (ΔG = -8.2 to -9.7 kcal/mol). These findings present promising antimicrobial candidates of 1,2,4-triazole-appended piperazine-stearic moiety derivatives.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance poses an urgent threat to global health, underscoring the critical need for new antibacterial drugs. Ciprofloxacin, a third-generation quinolone antibiotic, is used to treat different types of bacterial infections; however, it often results in the rapid emergence of resistance in clinical settings. Inspired by low susceptibility to antimicrobial resistance of natural antimicrobial peptides, we herein propose a host defense peptide-mimicking strategy for designing chimeric quinolone derivatives which may reduce the likelihood of antibacterial resistance. This strategy involves the incorporation of deliberately designed amphiphilic moieties into ciprofloxacin to mimic the structural characteristics and resistance-evading properties of host defense peptides. A resulting chimeric compound IPMCL-28b, carrying a rigid linker and three cationic amino acids along with a lipophilic acyl n-decanoyl tail, exhibited potent activity against a panel of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains by endowing the ciprofloxacin derivatives with additional ability to disrupt bacterial cell membranes. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that IPMCL-28b demonstrates significantly stronger disruptive interactions with cell membranes than ciprofloxacin. This compound not only demonstrated high selectivity with low hemolysis side effect, but also significantly reduced the likelihood of resistance development compared with ciprofloxacin. Excitingly, IPMCL-28b demonstrated highly enhanced in vivo antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with a 99.99 % (4.4 log) reduction in skin bacterial load after a single dose. These findings highlight the potential of host defense peptides-mimicking amphiphilic ciprofloxacin derivatives to reverse antibiotic resistance and mitigate the development of antimicrobial resistance.

AB  - The benzoxazoles and benzothiazoles derivatives have a variety of pharmacological activities, such as antimicrobial activity. Thus, in the present study, the antifungal activity of 13 benzoxazole and benzothiazole derivatives against Candida spp. strains were evaluated. Compound 1 presented strong antimicrobial action for C. krusei with MIC of 15.6 µg/mL, activities against strains of C. albicans (62.5 µg/mL), and C. tropicalis (125.0 µg/mL). In addition, it was evidenced that biological activity occurs in the plasma membrane in C. albicans. The results of the in silico study showed that the predicted inhibition of HSP90 and aldehyde dehydrogenase could explain the antifungal activity of Compound 1. New derivatives can be synthesized from the functionalization of these chemical structures and may result in more potent antifungal compounds, in addition to advancing the investigation of the mechanism of action. Therefore, the data highlight the potential of these compounds in the search for antimicrobial drugs.

AB  - Considering variability in microbial behavior has been recognized as a crucial element for predictive microbiology and quantitative microbial risk assessment. Although some sources of variability have been listed so far, a mathematical description of the variability in bacterial population behavior has not yet been realized. The present paper illustrates stochastic bacterial population growth and/or inactivation behavior from a mathematical point of view. Among various stochastic factors, sampling for the quantification of bacterial numbers and single-cell division/inactivation responses to food environments are highlighted as sources of technical and biological variability. Furthermore, the variability in sampling and single-cell division/inactivation responses emerges as variability in both number and time from the viewpoint of population dynamics. The aforementioned mathematical description of variability enables combining Poisson, binomial, and negative binomial distributions into traditional kinetic equations as its residual distribution. The primary focus is on the stochastic nature of variability, while it also includes discussions on incorporating parameter uncertainty into mathematical models. The traditional kinetic equation integrated with technical and biological variability and uncertainty enables a precise estimate of variation in population behavior, which would facilitate exposure assessment in quantitative microbial risk assessment.

AB  - Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is a significant pathogen impacting swine health and poses high zoonotic risks to humans. Effective antiviral treatments for PRV remain limited, underscoring the need for novel therapeutic strategies. In this study, ciprofloxacin was identified as a repurposed promising candidate with significant in vitro inhibition of PRV replication based on our inference from PNU-183792, an HSV-1 DNA polymerase inhibitor, that quinolones have the potential to act as anti-PRV drugs. Compound A1 was firstly hopping from ciprofloxacin and PNU-183792, showing more than 500-fold higher anti-PRV activity than ciprofloxacin with an EC

AB  - Developing innovative antimicrobial agents is essential in the fight against drug-resistant bacteria, as well as biofilms and persistent bacteria. In this study, four series of amphiphilic cephalosporin derivatives were synthesized. Most of the compounds showed good activity against Gram-positive bacteria, among which membrane-active cephalosporin 15e showed high activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, 15e can maintain antimicrobial activity in mammalian body fluids and does not develop detectable resistance. Antibacterial mechanism studies demonstrated that the compound 15e can destroy the bacterial cell membrane, causing leakage of intracellular nucleic acids and proteins. Moreover, it can also suppress bacterial metabolic activity and induce the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the bacteria. Of greater significance, compound 15e effectively prevented the formation of biofilms and eradicated established biofilms and persister cells. Notably, compound 15e exhibited potent in vivo antibacterial efficacy, which was better than cephalothin. These findings suggest that 15e has a potential to become a drug candidate for treating bacterial infections.

AB  - Combination of selenium (Se) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) can reduce the dose of Se used while concurrently exploiting their antioxidative performance, which can be used as a potential treatment for ulcerative colitis. Nanozymes possess higher stability, are more economical, and have more multifunctionalities than natural enzymes and thus could be an ideal approach for their combination. Therefore, this study synthesised a nanozyme using glutathione (GSH) and Se-GSH-Se-and evaluated its alleviating effects on colitis in mice induced by dextran sulphate sodium salt (DSS). Three doses of GSH-Se, 6 mM, 12 mM, and 18 mM were supplemented in DSS-induced colitis in mice. Findings showed that GSH-Se supplementation ameliorated colitis by improving the colonic mucosal integrity, reducing inflammatory responses and oxidative stress, and alleviating gut microbiota imbalance in mice with DSS-induced colitis. Moreover, an in vitro experiment was performed to unravel the molecular mechanism by which GSH-Se ameliorated colitis in mice, based on lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation in mouse colon epithelial cells. The results suggested that the alleviating effects of GSH-Se on mouse colitis was likely mediated by the activation of the Nrf2/Keap1 (nuclear factor E2-related factor 2/Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) and GPx4 signalling pathways.

AB  - Microbiological sampling and testing are widely utilized in food safety risk management. We developed risk assessments to quantify the impact of various sampling plans on the risk of invasive listeriosis to consumers. We used the FDA-iRISK® tool and adapted available process, consumption, and dose-response modules of published L. monocytogenes risk assessments to predict cases per billion servings from consumption of ready-to-eat foods. We also developed an ad hoc quantitative risk assessment application using R (the "FDA-LmQRA App") to evaluate more complex scenarios and provide additional metrics. Data and model inputs included the prevalence and levels of L. monocytogenes, sampling plan parameters, and operating characteristic curve data. We derived prevalence and between-lot distributions from data from market basket surveys of L. monocytogenes in ready-to-eat foods in the U.S. and examined two assumptions for the within-lot contamination: a lognormal distribution, or a heterogeneous distribution with a defined proportion of exceptional (higher level) contamination in addition to a single lognormal distribution. We found that testing each lot using 2-class plans (e.g., n = 5 or 10, m = 0/25 g or 0/5 g, and c = 0) or 3-class mixed plans (e.g., n = 5 or 10, m = 0/25 g or 0/5 g, M = 20 CFU/g or 100 CFU/g, and c = 1) and replacing positive lots by noncontaminated lots predicted quantifiable, but relatively low, risk reduction. The risk estimates were highly influenced by the variability of the between-lot concentration distribution as well as the presence of exceptional contamination for the within-lot contamination. In the presence of exceptional contamination, a 3-class mixed plan (c = 1) was predicted to have comparable performance based on risk estimates to a 2-class plan (corresponding n and m but c = 0). Results from this study may inform the choice of sampling plans to optimize sampling and testing strategies for reducing listeriosis associated with ready-to-eat foods.

AB  - Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product (SCFP), a postbiotic feed additive, has potential to improve animal growth and productivity. However, its effects on post-peak laying hens have not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effects of SCFP on production, egg quality, intestinal health, ovarian function, and cecal microbiota in post-peak laying hens. A total of 600 45-week-old Lohmann pink laying hens were randomly assigned into three treatments, with ten replicates and twenty hens per replicate. The hens were fed either a basal diet (CON) or basal diet supplemented with SCFP at 750 mg/kg (SCFP1) and 1250 mg/kg (SCFP2) for 16 weeks. The results showed no significant effects on the laying performance (P > 0.05). SCFP supplementation increased Haugh unit, yolk color, albumen height, and eggshell ratio compared to the CON diet(P < 0.05). Hens received SCFP diets exhibited a higher intestinal villus height-to-crypt depth ratio (P < 0.05) and up-regulated the expression of jejunal occludin, zonula occluden-1 (ZO-1), and mucin 2 (MUC-2) (P < 0.05). Additionally, SCFP supplementation increased the concentration of jejunal secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) (P < 0.05), elevated serum levels of immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgG, interleukin-10 (IL-10), and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (P < 0.05). Furthermore, dietary SCFP tended to decrease ovarian cell apoptosis and enhanced antioxidant capacity in laying hens (P < 0.05). Compared to CON group, the SCFP1 and SCFP2 groups had lower total bacteria and Escherichia coli, higher Lactobacillus (P < 0.05), and a greater abundance of Streptococcus, Pedosphaerales, Christensenellales, and Prevotellaceae in cecum. Significant correlations were observed between egg quality, intestinal health, ovarian function, and cecal microbiota. In addition, cecal microbial functional prediction indicated that SCFP altered various nutritional metabolism pathways. Dietary SCFP supplementation effectively improved egg quality in post-peak laying hens by modulating intestinal health, ovarian function, and cecal microbiota. Collectively, SCFP could be used as a valuable feed additive for post-peak laying hens, with 1250 mg/kg SCFP showing the better effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Canola essential oil (CEO) contains linoleic and oleic fatty acids that can inhibit the growth of pathogenic micro-organisms and alter microbial digestion to increase ruminal fermentation and nutrient utilisation. OBJECTIVES: The study evaluated the effect of supplementing a basal goat diet with incremental doses of CEO on chemical constituents and in vitro ruminal fermentation parameters and microbial diversity. METHODS: Experimental treatments were a basal goat diet containing 0.0025% antibiotic growth promoter (AGP) without CEO (POSCON), a basal diet without AGP and CEO (NEGCON), and NEGCON supplemented with 0.5 (CEO5), 1.0 (CEO10), 1.5 (CEO15), and 2.0% (v/w) CEO (CEO20). The treatment samples were homogenised, oven-dried, milled and analysed for chemical constituents. For the in vitro experiment, each sample (1 g) was weighed into serum bottles containing a pre-mixed phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.8) and pre-warmed (39°C) overnight. Ruminal inoculum from three donor goats was used for the incubation. Rumen fermentation parameters and volatile fatty acids were determined and the 16s rRNA gene of the fermentation medium was sequenced and amplified to detect the archaea and bacteria abundance. RESULTS: Dry matter and organic matter contents were lower (p < 0.05) for CEO15 and CEO20. Crude fat increased with CEO doses with the highest value recorded for CEO20. Treatment CEO20 produced the highest (p < 0.05) value for the immediately fermentable fraction, effective gas production and 96-h partition factor. Lag time had a positive quadratic effect whereas acetic and butyric acids conferred a positive quadratic effect in response to CEO inclusion. A total of 15 phyla, 46 genera and 65 species were identified. The Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria predominated the phyla groups while unclassified microbes, Prevotella and Succiniclasticum across all treatments predominated the genera and species. The genus Methanobrevibacter and Ruminococcus reduced significantly at CEO15 and CEO20. CONCLUSION: The inclusion of CEO in a basal goat diet increased gas production, partition factor at 96 hour of incubation and decreased total volatile fatty acids. However, 1.5% CEO level enhanced the abundance of fermentative bacteria such as Firmicutes and Actinobacteria while 1.5% and 2% CEO levels reduced the abundance of methanogenic microbes.

AB  - Influenza infection represents a serious challenge for virological surveillance and healthcare systems in all countries globally. Despite obvious success in control of influenza through vaccination and antiviral drug development, this infection remains poorly controlled due to antigenic drift and fast selection of drug-resistant viral variants. The design of novel drugs with alternative targets and mechanisms of action is, therefore, an important goal for medical science worldwide. In the current study, we describe the chemical synthesis of novel tetrahydro-β-carboline derivatives containing a thiohydantoin fragment, as well as their antiviral activity against influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1). In general, the library of compounds was of low toxicity. Of the 23 compounds under investigation, 10 (43.5%) displayed a selectivity index (SI) of 10 or higher, their activity strongly exceeding that of the reference compound rimantadine. The most active compounds have also demonstrated suppressing activity against the phylogenetically distinct influenza virus of type B. These compounds, similar to the reference compound zanamivir, were active at very late stages of the viral cycle (4-6 h postinfection), suggesting interference with processes of virion assembly and budding. However, no direct inhibiting activity against viral neuraminidase has been demonstrated. The results obtained can be considered as a rationale for further structural optimization and study of this group as potential broad-range antivirals effective against influenza viruses.

AB  - Candida albicans (C. albicans) is the most common cause of invasive Candida infections worldwide. The acquired resistance of C. albicans to fluconazole, a first-line antifungal drug, has been frequently reported, posing significant challenges to treatment. Combination therapy has emerged as an effective strategy to combat drug resistance. In this study, we synthesized a series of sinomenine derivatives and evaluated in vitro synergistic activity against azole-resistant C. albicans. The results demonstrated that compound 3ja exhibited a potent synergistic effect with fluconazole against azole-resistant C. albicans. Mechanism studies revealed that the combination of 3ja and FLC significantly induced reactive oxygen species accumulation, disrupted membrane integrity, altered membrane sterols, and promoted apoptosis in C. albicans.

AB  - Although phenothiazines have been widely explored in medicinal chemistry for over a century, little attention has been paid to their pyridine analogs, azaphenothiazines. This article reports the first synthesis, characterization, and antimicrobial evaluation of S-oxide analogs of N-aminoalkylated azaphenothiazines as antibacterials and antifungals. The optimized synthetic protocol enabled the production of the desired azaphenothiazine sulfoxides 12a-e and sulfonyls 14a-e, respectively. In addition to the x-ray crystal structure of azaphenothiazine sulfoxide intermediate 10, each target compound was characterized using spectroscopy techniques. All of these were investigated in vitro for antibacterial and antifungal activity against several strains of bacteria and fungi. Biological assays revealed selective antibacterial activity, with sulfoxides (12a-e) exhibiting broad inhibition and sulfones (14a-e) showing selectivity toward gram-negative bacteria. Compound 12c demonstrated fourfold higher potency against Escherichia coli than the reference drug. In antifungal studies, compound 14c showed the highest activity (MIC 1.2 µg/mL against Candida albicans). Our in silico evaluations utilized molecular dynamic (MD) and docking studies for active-site binding simulations, revealing favorable drug-like properties and pharmacokinetics. Finally, toxicology assays determined all synthesized analogs to be non-toxic to kidney and hepatic tissues. This report highlights the newly described S-oxide azaphenothiazine conjugates and their potential as potent antimicrobial agents.

AB  - New s-triazine hydrazone hybrids (4a-4r) were designed and synthesized as promising microbial DNA gyrase inhibitors. This was done by taking the lead DNA gyrase inhibitor (AstraZeneca arylaminotriazine) as a reference. The novel samples were subsequently tested as antimicrobial agents against certain pathogenic bacteria and unicellular fungi. The antibiofilm potential and the membrane leakage test were used to determine the mechanism of the antimicrobial response. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 4g, 4i, and 4r samples were between 62.5 and 250.0 µg/mL. The MIC values for the 4g candidate against Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, Enterobacter agglomerans, and Klebsiella pneumonia are 62.5, 125.0, and 250.0 µg/mL, respectively. Conversely, the MIC of compound 4i was 62.5 µg/mL for C. albicans and E. agglomerans and 125.0 µg/mL for S. aureus and K. pneumonia. Besides, a molecular docking study was performed to validate both the binding affinity and binding mode of the newly designed analogs of s-triazine candidates toward bacterial DNA gyrase receptors. The synthesized nanocomposites had promising antimicrobial potentials, which are encouraging their use in biomedical applications. Consequently, the afforded compounds can be employed as promising antimicrobial lead compounds for future optimization.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance has grown to become a global crisis consistently participating in the death of millions worldwide and accumulating costs on healthcare. Quorum sensing inhibition is a new alternative antimicrobial strategy that has been gaining attention due to its ability to suppress the resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). This approach shows great potential in overcoming bacterial resistance and could provide a much needed substitute to conventional antibiotics in the future. PA has 3 main quorum sensing systems of which the Las system has been identified to be the most viable therapeutic target. In this study, we report the synthesis of a library of novel broad-spectrum quorum sensing inhibitors from the dihydropyrrol-2-one scaffold to form urea and imidazolium analogues. Molecular docking was performed in parallel to synthesis to aid design. It also confirmed that the molecules comfortably occupy the ligand binding domain in addition to potential key interactions commonly present in LasR inhibitors. As predicted, these compounds displayed low bactericidal effects against P. aeruginosa with most compounds exhibiting MIC of >250 μM, while maintaining moderate activity towards Escherichia coli with the most potent compound having an MIC of 32 μM. The greatest bactericidal effects were present on Staphylococcus aureus with the thiourea based molecule 10c showed the highest antibacterial activity with MIC of 16 µM. Furthermore, several molecules displayed highly potent quorum sensing inhibitory activity with compounds 10g and 9e both demonstrating over 70 % inhibition respectively of the LasR system at 16 µM. These compounds also expressed inhibition of pyocyanin within P. aeruginosa and haemolytic assay indicates a low level of cell lysis and hence low toxicity of the compounds, further demonstrating the potential of these novel compounds.

AB  - In this study, 30 tilmicosin-hydrazone derivatives were designed using MOE software. Six candidate molecules with strong binding affinity to DNA or DNA-Topo II complexes, as indicated by molecular docking results, were synthesized. These candidates were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activities against common Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Compounds Z-12 and Z-22 demonstrated superior inhibitory effects against most tested strains compared to reference drugs tilmicosin and erythromycin, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 1 μg/mL against S. aureus 25,923 and S. aureus 29,213. HPLC results indicated that Z-12 and Z-22 exhibited improved stability in acidic aqueous solutions compared to tilmicosin. UV-vis, fluorescence spectroscopy, and gel electrophoresis studies confirmed their intercalation into DNA base pairs via a static quenching mechanism. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) revealed irreversible oxidation processes on the glassy carbon electrode, providing insights into their potential metabolic pathways. Finally, a mouse wound infection model demonstrated that Z-12 and Z-22 exhibited good antibacterial efficacy, biocompatibility, and enhanced wound healing effects, surpassing those of tilmicosin. These findings, coupled with their prolonged metabolic half-life, highlight their potential as effective antibacterial agents.

AB  - Research has shown that exposure to coastal waters containing antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) is associated with higher likelihood of gut colonisation by ARB. The aim was to identify landscape-scale processes contributing to the spread of ARB in Hong Kong's coastal waters and to estimate the scale of bathers' exposure to ARB. Twelve recreational water locations were sampled in 2017 for Escherichia coli. A targeted metagenomic approach was used to quantify the abundance and diversity of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) harboured by viable E. coli. Data on environmental variables related to ARB distribution in the environment were modelled to identify processes driving the abundance and diversity of ARG-bearing E. coli in coastal waters. These data were combined with data about Hong Kong residents' use of blue space to quantify human exposure to E. coli borne ARG. Several meteorological variables, like rainfall and temperature, were associated with E. coli-borne ARG profiles. Yet when rigorous statistical methods were applied, these relationships were not significant. Meropenem-resistant bacteria were also isolated from samples, most of which were taken from western beaches. Additionally, there was some evidence of elevated abundances of several ARGs, including bla

AB  - The continuous evolution of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria to existing antibiotic treatment regimens poses a serious threat to human health, so the discovery of new and potent antimicrobial drugs that are less likely to develop resistance is of great clinical significance. As a result, oxazolidinone antibiotics have emerged as a significant class of bacterial protein synthesis inhibitors, with particular success in the treatment of MDR Gram-positive infections. Herein, a series of novel C-ring modified oxazolidinone derivatives with the introduction of N-methylglycyl groups or quaternary ammonium salts were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial efficacy, among which most of the N-methylglycyl derivatives showed significant activity against E. faecalis. Notably, compounds 11g-11i showed good activity against E. faecalis and S. aureus with MICs of 2-8 μg/mL. The selected compound 11g exhibited rapid bactericidal properties, good biofilm disruption capacity, low tendency to induce bacterial resistance, and low cytotoxicity against mammalian cells (HeLa). Furthermore, compound 11g showed relatively good stability in mammalian body fluids and exhibited a longer post-antibiotic effect (PAE). Mechanistic studies showed that compound 11g exerted its antibacterial effect by inhibiting glutathione (GSH) activity and inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, leading to bacterial death. These findings suggest that 11g is a promising candidate for the exploitation of N-methylglycyl oxazolidinones as novel antibacterial agents.

AB  - Vancomycin is primarily used to treat severe infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria and is often considered as the last-resort therapy in the life-threatening situation. However, it is inherently ineffective against Gram-negative bacteria. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of novel vancomycin analogues incorporated with lipophilic cationic groups. Through structural optimization and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, we identified vancomycin analogue 18b, which exhibited remarkable antibacterial activity against A. baumannii ATCC 17978, with a MIC of 8 μg/mL. In contrast, vancomycin showed no activity against this strain, even at concentration as high as 128 μg/mL. Further investigations revealed that 18b possesses rapid bactericidal properties, low toxicity, and a reduced propensity to induce bacterial resistance. The exceptional antibacterial performance of 18b is partially attributed to the presence of membrane-targeting, lipophilic piperazine cationic groups. In a mouse model infected with A. baumannii ATCC 17978, 18b exhibited excellent efficacy at a dose of 20 mg/kg, while no toxicity was observed. These findings highlight 18b as a promising candidate for further development in the fight against Gram-negative bacterial infections.

AB  - The increasing infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) poses a serious threat to global public health. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are alternatives to conventional antibiotics in combating superbugs. However, discovering AMPs with low synthesis costs and strong antibacterial effects against CRAB is challenging. In this study, we synthesized 28 dodecapeptides for bactericidal assessment by site mutation and all-hydrocarbon stapling on the basis of the antibacterial core of human cathelicidin. The linear derivative d12 (Q5RD9I-KR12) and the i, i + 4 stapled peptide d24, which was generated by substituting Val

AB  - A novel class of benzopyrone-sulfanilamide hybrids was synthesized from phenols via multi-step reactions. Some prepared compounds effectively suppressed bacterial growth at low concentrations, and especially, sulfanilamide-hybridized 2-methyl-5-nitroimidazolyl benzopyrone 11c exhibited significant inhibitory potency against Escherichia coli (MIC = 0.0022 mM), which was 11-fold more active than clinical norfloxacin. Furthermore, compound 11c showed negligible hemolytic activity, low cytotoxicity and no drug resistance. Mechanistic studies indicated that the highly active 11c disrupted bacterial membrane integrity, reduced metabolic activity, bound DNA grooves to inhibit replication without the ability to cleave DNA, and induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, collectively leading to bacterial death. These results highlight the potential of sulfanilamide-hybridized benzopyrones as multitarget antibacterial agents, warranting further development to combat bacterial infections.

AB  - The dairy industry in developing countries is often associated with inappropriate use of antibiotics and the subsequent contamination of the environment with co-selectors of antibiotic resistance. However, the specific factors in dairy farm environments that influence antibiotic resistance levels and the subsequent exposure risks to farm workers are unknown. We examined the link between the infrastructure and operations of the dairy farm and the antibiotic resistance potential in India, which is the highest producer and consumer of dairy products globally. We sampled sixteen dairy farms in the Dehradun district, India, that varied in their herd size, infrastructure, and operational features during winter, summer, and monsoon. We collected samples of dung, manure, wastewater, manure-amended, and control soil from these farms. We quantified six antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (sul1, sul2, parC, mcr5, ermF, and tetW), an integron integrase gene cassette (intI1), and 16S rRNA gene copies as an indicator for total bacterial count. We observed that the infrastructure and the operations of the dairy farms were significantly associated with antibiotic resistance potential in the dairy environment. For example, with increased ventilation and exposure to external weather, the levels of sul2 (x͂=10

CvLTI was isolated using a trypsin-agarose column and evaluated for stability towards heating (30°C- 100°C) and incubation at different pH values (2.0-10.0). Furthermore, CvLTI was investigated for antibacterial activity against phytopathogens, hemolytic activity as well as cytotoxicity and immunomodulatory effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). CvLTI (14.3 kDa, pI 5.3) showed sequence similarities with an endochitinase and showed a trypsin inhibitory activity thermostable and higher at acidic pH. The inhibitor exerted bacteriostatic effects on Pectobacterium isolates (minimum inhibitory concentration: 462 µg/mL). CvLTI showed hemolytic activity with an EC

AB  - The objective of the present study was to improve the antimicrobial profile of ciprofloxacin by introducing a peptidomimetic function. A ciprofloxacin C3 carboxyl group was modified by a three-component Passerini reaction conducted under micellar conditions. The series of newly synthesized peptidomimetics was evaluated for their possible in vitro antibacterial activity toward including selected LPS-varied E. coli strains. A preliminary exploration of ciprofloxacin-based peptidomimetic analogues as novel antimicrobial agents was carried out to determine the basic characteristics of the structure responsible for the observed biological activity. The collected data demonstrated that an appropriate modification of the C3 position of ciprofloxacin significantly extends and improves antimicrobial activity, particularly against LPS-varied E. coli strains, which may cause various diseases such as urinary tract infections (UTI), enteric / diarrheal disease, and sepsis/meningitis. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activities of peptidomimetics against selected Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains belonging to ESKAPE bacteria (A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, and S. aureus) were investigated. All synthesized ciprofloxacin derivatives were found to be more potent antibacterial agents than the native compound. Most importantly, the introduction of a short aliphatic substituent into the peptidomimetic structure allowed to enhance and extend the activity of modified ciprofloxacin not only to the native E. coli strain but also to all of its tested mutants. The results showed that all tested peptidomimetics have enhanced antimicrobial activities (MIC values from 0.22 to 2.19 μM) as compared to ciprofloxacin (MIC = 0.62 to 3.44 μg/mL). Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of sixteen derivatives was measured using the MTT test on BALB/c3T3 mouse fibroblast cell lines. Cytotoxicity studies revealed that the tested substances exert a similar or lower effect on cell proliferation than that observed for native ciprofloxacin. This study presents that it is possible to extend the antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin by appropriate modification of its structure, which can prolong its use. This is very important in light of the reports incoming on pathogens in nosocomial infections that acquire resistance to this antibiotic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Up to 50% of kidney transplant patients are diagnosed with delayed graft function (DGF) following transplantation-the majority being linked to ischaemia reperfusion injury (IRI). DGF is traditionally defined as the requirement for dialysis during the first week after transplantation and is associated with inferior graft and patient outcomes. Local synthesis of complement components, largely by the renal tubule, plays a critical role in IRI. We have developed Mirococept, a membrane-targeted complement inhibitor, that can be administered to the donor kidney ex vivo prior to transplantation. After administration, Mirococept is retained in the donor organ, thereby minimising the risk of systemic side effects. We previously launched the EMPIRIKAL study aiming to evaluate the efficacy of Mirococept in reducing DGF in deceased-donor kidney transplantation (KT). The funding body recommended termination of the study to allow a dose-saturating study before the next stage of clinical evaluation. This was carried out in a porcine kidney model and led to a revised dosing regimen for EMPIRIKAL-2 (60-180 mg compared with 5-25 mg in the initial trial). The EMPIRIKAL-2 trial (REC 24/NE/0071) aims to identify the most safe and efficacious dose of Mirococept to reduce DGF rate in deceased-donor KT. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: EMPIRIKAL-2 is a Phase IIa multicentre double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT) with an initial safety run. Participants will be recruited from renal departments at National Health Service tertiary hospital sites in the UK. The purpose of the safety run is to assess the tolerance of each of the three proposed Mirococept doses (60, 120 or 180 mg), before the RCT begins. Three patients will be assigned to each treatment dose, starting from the lower dose. The safety run will be considered successful if at least one dose can be taken forward to the RCT for comparison to placebo.If safety is met, 144 participants (36 per arm excluding drop-outs) will be randomised to all doses meeting the safety criteria or placebo on a 1:1:1:1 basis. The primary endpoint is DGF, defined as the requirement for dialysis during the first week after transplantation. Safety evaluation will include the monitoring of laboratory data and the recording of all adverse events. Immunosuppression therapy, antibiotic and antiviral prophylaxis will be administered as per local centre protocols. Enrolment in the RCT is anticipated to take approximately 12 months, and patients will be followed-up for 12 months. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the Northeast - Newcastle and North Tyneside 2 Research Ethics Service Committee, REC reference 24/NE/0071. The results of the study will be reported and disseminated at international conferences and in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Once published, a lay summary of the results will be made available to participants who request this information. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN14279222. Registered on 4 July 2024.

AB  - The increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria necessitates the development of novel antimicrobial agents with targeted specificity. In this study, we designed and optimized derivatives of the antimicrobial peptide AA16, which truncated from CD14 protein α-helical region, to selectively target Gram-negative bacteria by enhancing lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-enriched interactions, thereby achieving antibacterial spectrum conversion. Starting from the parent peptide AA16 (Ac-AARIPSRILFGALRVL-Amide), we performed strategic amino acid substitutions based on structure-activity relationship analysis. This led to the identification of AA16-10R, a derivative with a specific substitution at position 10, which demonstrated significantly enhanced antibacterial activity against Gram-negative strains such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while maintaining low hemolytic activity. Mechanistic studies revealed that AA16-10R exhibited a strong binding affinity to LPS (K

AB  - Penicillin binding protein 4 (PBP4) is essential for Staphylococcus aureus cortical bone osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network (OLCN) invasion, which causes osteomyelitis and serves as a bacterial niche for recurring bone infection. Moreover, PBP4 is also a key determinant of S. aureus resistance to fifth-generation cephalosporins (ceftobiprole and ceftaroline). From these perspectives, the development of S. aureus PBP4 inhibitors may represent dual functional therapeutics that prevent osteomyelitis, and reverse PBP4-mediated β-lactam resistance. A high-throughput screen for small molecules that inhibit S. aureus PBP4 function identified compound 1. We recently described a preliminary structure activity relationship (SAR) study on 1, identifying several compounds with increased PBP4 inhibitory activity, some of which also inhibit PBP2a. Herein, we expand our exploration of phenyl ureas as antibiotic adjuvants, investigating their activity with penicillins and additional cephalosporins against PBP2a-mediated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). We screened the previously reported pilot library, and prepared an additional series of phenyl ureas based on compound 1. Lead compounds potentiate multiple β-lactam antibiotics, lowering minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) below susceptibility breakpoints, with up to 64-fold reductions in MIC.

AB  - Water scarcity presents a pressing and lasting challenge to many large cities, necessitating adaptations in urban water systems. Developing reliable water resources is crucial for enhancing water security, yet concerns regarding costs and environmental impacts persist. To address this, we have developed an integrated framework that combines life cycle assessment (LCA), quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA), and life cycle costing (LCC) for evaluating the environmental, public health, and economic impacts of water systems. Our approach culminates in a unified monetary representation encapsulating the overall life-cycle costs of the urban water system borne by all stakeholders. City-wide and district-level water systems in Hong Kong were analyzed to demonstrate the benefits of this integrated LCA-QMRA-LCC approach over individual assessments. By quantifying both private and external costs (e.g., environmental and health impacts), we found that the external costs can exceed 50 % of the private costs in both cases, which would potentially influence the decision-making outcomes. Notably, for the district-level study that compared the use of seawater and reclaimed water for toilet flushing, disparities were unveiled between the individual and integrated assessments, underscoring the necessity of a broad LCA-QMRA-LCC framework. This research equips decision-makers with a comprehensive analytical tool, addressing concerns across a broader spectrum of stakeholders and fostering sustainable and cost-effective urban water management.

AB  - Due to the prolonged misuse of antimicrobial agents and the development of various resistance mechanisms, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged as a leading threat to the public health. The production of a penicillin binding protein 2a (PBP2a) plays a crucial role in cell wall synthesis of MRSA, and conformational alterations in PBP2a impede the effective binding of β-lactam antibiotics, the most effective class of antibiotic, to the active site. The PBP2a allosteric site located 60 Å from the active site, and binding of allosteric site significantly influences the conformational dynamics of the active site. Based on the effect of nucleoside which re-sensitizes MRSA to β-lactam antibiotics, we conducted extensive virtual screening to design and synthesize a series of novel nucleoside inhibitors targeting the allosteric site of MRSA PBP2a. These inhibitors exhibit a distinct chemical structure compared to existing clinical antibiotics. Notably, compound 13e demonstrated a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 16 µg/mL against MRSA strain, showcasing superior antibacterial activity relative to the reference antibiotic. Time-kill curve indicated that compound 13e effectively inhibit bacterial growth. Interestingly, a synergistic effect was observed at low concentrations of compound 13e in combination treatment with Oxacillin, whereas antagonism occurred at higher concentrations of compound 13e. The morphological observation showed the integrity of the bacterial cell wall was disrupted after compound 13e treatment, and it exhibited a lower propensity for developing resistance compared to cephalosporin. Additionally, this compound did not affect the viability of normal human intestinal epithelial cells (HIEC) and brain microvascular endothelial cells at concentration much higher than MIC. Over all, this unique antibacterial mechanism underscores the optimization potential of these nucleoside compounds, providing new perspectives and methodologies for the development of novel antimicrobial agents.

AB  - Biowaste-derived nanoparticles (NPs) are gaining attention for their biocompatibility, environmental friendliness, and affordability. This study synthesized silver NPs (Ag NPs), zinc oxide NPs (ZnO NPs), and silver-doped zinc oxide NPs (Ag/ZnO NPs) using termite wing biowaste (Odontotermes obesus). The synthesized NPs were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, FTIR, SEM-EDX, XRD, and atomic force microscopy (AFM), confirming successful biosynthesis and purity. AFM provided 3D profiling of the average sizes of 28.4, 19.6, and 11 nm for Ag NPs, ZnO NPs, and Ag/ZnO NPs, respectively. Among these three NPs, Ag/ZnO NPs showed superior antioxidant activity in DPPH (86 ± 3.61%), ABTS (76 ± 1.5%), and nitric oxide assays (77 ± 1%). In vitro studies demonstrated their significant antibacterial and anticancer potential against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and HeLa cells, with >80% cell viability reduction at 100 µg/mL. These findings highlight the potential of Ag/ZnO NPs as antioxidants, antibacterial agents, and anticancer agents, warranting further in vivo studies for biomedical applications.

AB  - Tuberculosis is a global epidemic caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, predominantly impacting underprivileged regions worldwide. Here, we identified a novel 1,3-disubstituted pyrazole derivative, compound A, that exhibits antitubercular activity through in vitro screening. Further SAR studies resulted in the identification of compounds 4c and 6b, which exhibited improved antitubercular activity, with MIC values of 5.34 and 5.04 μg/mL against H37Ra, respectively. Additionally, compounds 4c and 6b exhibited favorable safety profiles, showing no obvious toxicity to Vero, A549, and HepG2 cell lines. Our docking studies suggest that PptT may serve as one of the potential targets for these compounds. These encouraging results provide valuable insights for the development of novel structured antitubercular agents.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite stringent infection control measures, Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) remains a challenge in healthcare settings, partly due to overlooked transmission vectors such as toilet plume bioaerosols. AIM: To systematically quantify the risks associated with CDI transmission via toilet flushing and provide critical insights to inform CDI preventive strategies. METHODS: Impaction sampling was used to quantify airborne C. difficile post-flush and high-contact surfaces were swabbed to assess contamination levels, in a controlled toilet environment. A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) approach was then used to estimate the risk to subsequent users from contamination by a previously colonized individual. FINDINGS: A single flush can release C. difficile into the air, with bioaerosol concentrations up to 29.50 ± 10.52 cfu/m CONCLUSION: The findings of this study necessitate a review of current toilet designs, public health policies and facility management practices to mitigate the overlooked risks of CDI transmission through toilet plume bioaerosols in healthcare settings. Additionally, this study lays a foundation for developing evidence-based interventions aimed at achieving substantial behavioural and infrastructural changes in infection control practices.

AB  - Numerous studies have reported that asperuloside (ASP), a monomeric compound extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine Spreading Hedyotis Herb, possesses a variety of medicinal properties, including the treatment of obesity, cancer, inflammatory diseases, and bacterial infections. However, its role in innate immunity and the underlying mechanisms of action remain largely unexplored. Protein homeostasis and the health of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are crucial for organismal function, as a well-balanced ER is essential not only for maintaining cellular integrity but also for ensuring immune homeostasis. In this study, we demonstrated that asperuloside enhances the resistance of Caenorhabditis elegans to the human opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 and reduces the bacterial load within its intestine. Additionally, asperuloside promotes innate immunity by activating the IRE-1/XBP-1 signaling pathway. Furthermore, asperuloside protects A549 human lung epithelial cells and mice against PA14 infection through the IRE-1/XBP-1 signaling pathway. Our findings indicate that the ability of asperuloside to promote innate immunity is conserved across invertebrates and mammals, offering new insights for the future development of antibacterial drugs.

AB  - Enteric pathogens, particularly bacterial pathogens, are associated with millions of cases of foodborne illness in the U.S. and worldwide, necessitating the identification and development of methods to control and minimize their impact on public health. Predictive modeling and quantitative microbial risk assessment are two such methods that analyze data on microbial behavior, particularly as a response to changes in the food matrix, to predict and control the presence and prevalence of these pathogens in food. However, a number of these bacterial enteric pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella enterica, have inherent genetic and phenotypic differences among their subtypes and variants. This has led to an increasing reliance on "omics" technologies, including genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, to identify and characterize pathogenic microorganisms and their behavior in food systems. With this exponential increase in available data on these enteric pathogens, comes a need for the development of novel strategies to analyze this data. Advanced data analysis/analytics is a means to extract value from these large data sources, and is considered the core of data processing. In the past few years, advanced data analytics methods such as machine learning and artificial intelligence have been increasingly used to extract meaningful, actionable knowledge from these data sources to help mitigate food safety issues caused by enteric pathogens. This chapter reviews the latest in research into the use of advanced data analytics, particularly machine learning, to analyze "omics" data of enteric bacterial pathogens, and identifies potential future uses of these techniques in mitigating the risk of these pathogens on public health.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) show considerable promise in combating bacterial infections due to their broad-spectrum efficacy, unique mechanisms of action, and resistance capabilities. In this study, we de novo designed a series of α-helical AMPs (Z1-Z6) with enhanced antimicrobial activity, anti-biofilm, and anti-inflammatory effects. The design incorporated isoleucine with long alkyl side chains and carefully balanced the positive charge and hydrophobicity. Among the designed peptides, Z2 demonstrated remarkable properties. In vitro assays revealed a high therapeutic index, with effective inhibition of 10 pathogenic and drug-resistant bacterial strains by disrupting cell membranes and interacting with bacterial genomes. Z2 also significantly suppressed biofilm formation and reduced reactive oxygen species production in RAW264.7 cells, leading to a decrease in inflammatory cytokine expression, thus showing anti-inflammatory activity. In a mouse model of acute Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia, Z2 significantly improved survival rates, efficiently cleared bacteria from the lungs, and alleviated lung damage. Overall, Z2's unique design endows it with excellent antimicrobial, anti-biofilm, and anti-inflammatory activities, suggesting its great potential as a novel antimicrobial agent for further development. Future research will focus on the studying the drug formulations, elucidating the mechanisms underlying Z2's anti-inflammatory effects and exploring its therapeutic potential in other infection models.

Enteric microorganisms are often collected from groundwater via dead-end ultrafiltration, but recovery of PRRSV and PCV with this method has not been assessed. We recovered PRRSV2 and PCV2 by dead-end ultrafiltration followed by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation, nucleic acid extraction, and reverse-transcription quantitative real-time PCR. We also compared 2 commercial hemodialysis ultrafilters (Asahi Kasei Rexeed-25A, Nipro Elisio-25H) and compared PRRSV2 recovery in these filters to other waterborne microorganisms. On average, 8 ± 1% of PRRSV2 was recovered by dead-end ultrafiltration and PEG precipitation, compared to 25 ± 6% for adenovirus 41. Full-process recovery of bacteria in the same filters was 5-15%;

AB  - Methoxychlor as a persistent organic pollutant poses significant risks to human health and the environment. Most toxicological studies focus on high-dose exposures, which do not reflect typical chronic and low-dose human exposure, necessitating the examination of the cumulative effects of chronic exposure to persistent organic pollutants. Our study exposed broilers to different concentrations of p,p'-methoxychlor (0.01-5 mg/kg) in feed, reflecting the doses commonly used in agricultural practices. The results show that even at low doses, methoxychlor causes liver damage, metabolic disturbances, disrupts the intestinal microbiota, and leads to significant accumulation of residues, particularly in the liver. When methoxychlor contamination in the feed exceeds 0.01 mg/kg, residue levels in the broiler liver surpass the EU-established limit, and the residue levels in the broiler muscle surpass this limit when contamination exceeds 0.2 mg/kg. In addition, methoxychlor disrupts the gut microbiota, causing significant shifts in microbial composition, including a decrease in beneficial bacteria and an increase in potentially harmful taxa. The gut dysbiosis, bioaccumulation potential of methoxychlor and changes in liver metabolic indicators may be associated with the liver pathology observed in this study, warranting further investigation. The harmful consequences significantly impact broiler production, leading to food safety concerns and risks to human health. At similar exposure levels, humans may face health risks comparable to those observed in broilers. This study provides important evidence for establishing strict regulations on methoxychlor residues in food products and assessing the potential risks of low-dose and long-term exposure to methoxychlor.

AB  - With the increasing need for monitoring viral contamination in aquatic environments, research has increasingly focused on utilizing viruses as indicators for microbial contamination assessment. However, studies on enrichment techniques for waterborne viruses and their occurrence and risk characteristics in the environment remain relatively limited. In this study, samples were collected over one year from a wastewater treatment plant and its receiving stream to evaluate the optimal enrichment method and to assess the presence of four representative viral indicators-human adenovirus (HAdV), crAssPhage, enterovirus (EV), and the pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV)-in the urban water environment. The results showed that skimmed milk flocculation (SMF) and silica attachment method (SAM) achieved better viral enrichment performance in both wastewater and surface water, demonstrating greater seasonal consistency compared to other methods. Seasonal variations in virus concentrations were observed, with HAdV and crAssphage peaking in winter, while EV and PMMoV peaked in summer. Virus concentrations in wastewater treatment plants were reduced by 8.61 log10 copies/L from influent to effluent. However, residual viruses discharged into receiving streams still pose a significant environmental exposure risk, as indicated by Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) results, which exhibited a strong correlation with population density. This study highlights the importance of waterborne viral indicators in developing effective water quality management strategies to ensure the safe control of viruses in aquatic environments.

AB  - Three previously undescribed formyl-phloroglucinol meroterpenoids eucalypglobulusals K-M (1-3), one phloroglucinol derivative (16), and sixteen known analogues were isolated from the petroleum ether extract of Eucalyptus globulus leaves. The structures of new compounds (1-3, 16) were determined by extensive spectroscopic analysis, X-ray diffraction, experimental and calculated ECD spectroscopic analysis, as well as Mosher esterification experiment. Compound 3 gave the first example of coupling model of guaiane and diformyl-isopentyl phloroglucinol via forming 1-oxa[4,5]-spirocyclic system through C9'/C-15. Among these isolates, eucalypglobulusal L (2), eucalypglobulusal H (8), and eucalrobusone C (10) exhibited moderate cytotoxic activity against a panel of cancer cell lines with IC

AB  - Rhabdoviruses are diverse pathogens known for their broad host range and significant economic and health impacts. Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), a member of the Novirhabdovirus genus, poses a major threat to aquaculture, particularly affecting rainbow trout. In this study, we further optimize the antiviral properties of arctigenin derivatives based on our previous structure-activity relationship (SAR) research, leading to the synthesis of TZOA. TZOA was synthesized with a 45 % yield and demonstrated no cytotoxicity up to 25 μM in EPC cells. Treatment with TZOA markedly inhibited IHNV replication dose-dependently, achieving over 90 % suppression of viral N, G, and M genes at 25 μM. Notably, TZOA effectively reduced viral titers compared to controls, demonstrating its potent antiviral activity in vitro. Mechanistically, TZOA preserved mitochondrial integrity, mitigated virus-induced mitochondrial fragmentation, and maintained membrane potential in infected cells. Furthermore, TZOA facilitated mitochondrial fusion and mitophagy, clearing damaged mitochondria, which restored MAVS-mediated interferon expression, thus enhancing the host's innate antiviral response. In vivo studies in juvenile rainbow trout revealed a significant 44 % increase in survival rates with TZOA treatment, accompanied by reduced IHNV-induced mortality and viral gene expression in spleen and kidney tissues. Importantly, TZOA also inhibited IHNV horizontal transmission, highlighting its potential application in controlling viral spread. These findings emphasize TZOA as a promising therapeutic candidate, not only for IHNV but also for broader rhabdovirus infections, offering valuable insights for antiviral drug development in aquaculture and beyond.

AB  - The Gram-negative, pathogenic bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) have been identified as a particular threat due to rising multidrug resistance, and antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action are needed. Bacterial bioenergetics is a promising but underdeveloped drug target since the complexes of oxidative phosphorylation are critical to cell survival in these organisms. Building from our previous work using quinoline derivatives to inhibit the ATP synthase of PA, we report a new set of 14 quinoline derivatives that demonstrates potent inhibition of the AB ATP synthase, with the best inhibitor having an IC50 of 230 ng/mL in vitro, expands the quinoline structure-activity relationship against the PA enzyme, and establishes molecular strategies for achieving selectivity between PA and AB. Furthermore, several compounds demonstrated potent antibacterial activity against multidrug resistant strains of AB and PA indicating ATP synthase as a promising new area for broad spectrum antibiotic development in AB.

AB  - Chronic infections by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) are frequently complicated due to its ability to form biofilm, which also effectively enhance its resistance to antibiotics. Bacteria-specific antibiotic delivery could locally increase drug concentration to break antimicrobial resistance and reduce the drug's peripheral side effects. The standard-of-care drug ciprofloxacin suffers from severe systemic side effects and was therefore chosen for this approach. It has been identified that 3-hydroxypyridin-4(1H)-one as siderophore mimics could be utilized by P. aeruginosa, and reduced bacterial biofilm formation. In this work, ciprofloxacin was conjugated to 3-hydroxypyridin-4(1H)-one by cleavable linkers to yield prodrugs, which were strategically designed and synthesized to function as dual antibacterial and antibiofilm agents against P. aeruginosa. Conjugate 5c was identified and has the best minimum inhibitory concentrations of 1.07 μM against P. aeruginosa PAO1, and reduced 61.7 % of biofilm formation. In addition, 5c destroyed 75.7 % of mature biofilms. Further studies on the uptake mechanisms showed that the bacterial siderophore-dependent iron transport system was involved in the uptake of the conjugates. Conjugate 5c interfered with iron uptake by bacteria, inhibited their motilities and reduced the production of virulence. Furthermore, prodrug 5c reduced toxicity in vivo and in vitro and showed a positive therapeutic effect in the treatment of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) infected by P. aeruginosa. These results demonstrate that 3-hydroxypyridin-4(1H)-ones-ciprofloxacin prodrugs are potent in the treatment of biofilm-associated drug-resistant P. aeruginosa infections.

AB  - Novel 2,4-thiazolidinedione-benzothiazole-triazole hybrids (7a-7l) were designed and synthesized as therapeutic agents with pleotropic activity for Alzheimer's disease (AD). These compounds were evaluated for their acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitory activities. Compound 7k, exhibited exceptional AChE inhibition (IC₅₀ = 0.083 μM), while compound 7d, showed potent activity (IC₅₀ = 0.119 μM). Kinetic studies revealed that 7k was able to exert its action through mixed types of inhibition. Also, the anti-inflammatory potential of these lead compounds was assessed in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Both compounds demonstrated significant dose-dependent inhibition of key inflammatory mediators, including NO, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β at non-cytotoxic concentrations (≤10 μM). Notably, compound 7k exhibited superior anti-inflammatory activity, achieving 92 % NO inhibition, 65 % TNF-α reduction, and 61.1 % IL-1β suppression at 10 μM.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of degraded polysaccharide of Acanthopanax senticosus (ASPS-1) on the immunological effects and appropriate dosage of broiler chicks with a view to developing a new feed additive. For the experimental design, 180 broiler chicks were randomly divided into six groups, ASPS-1 low, medium and high dose groups, undegraded Acanthopanax senticosus polysaccharide (ASPS) low and medium dose groups and blank control group. The drug was administered for 21 consecutive days, and the growth and data of immune organ index and immune factors were recorded on the 7th, 14th and 21st d. Finally, the effect of ASPS-1 on the intestinal flora of broiler chicks was investigated by high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and the correlation between the main flora and intestinal indexes was analyzed, and the function of microbial community was predicted by using PICRUSt2. The results showed that the addition of high dose of ASPS-1 could promote the body weight growth of broiler chicks, had no significant effect on immune organs, significantly promoted the increase of intestinal villi and crypt ratio, and effectively regulated the levels of serum antioxidant factors and immune indexes. Analysis of the intestinal flora showed that ASPS-1H promoted the proliferation of Lactobacillus, Faecalibacterium, Negativibacillus, and Eubacterium and inhibited the colonization of Desulfovibrio and Turicibacter, and that proliferation of Faecalibacterium, Negativibacillus and Eubacterium was associated with the development of intestinal villi. Predictive analysis of PICRUSt2 function indicates that proliferation of Lactobacillus, Faecalibacterium, Negativibacillus and Eubacterium functions through amino acid metabolism, global and overview maps, replication and repair pathways function. In summary, the addition of high doses of ASPS-1 can improve the immunity of broilers and has the potential to be used as a feed additive.

AB  - To evaluate the effect of amination on biofilm inhibition against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, representative compounds of two previously described 5-aryl-2-aminoimidazole (5-Ar-2-AI) classes were aminated by installing an amino group at the end of the substituted n-alkyl chain. Amination led to an improvement in activity for one of the two classes, the 2N-substituted 5-Ar-2-AI class. Based on these findings, a more extensive library of 2N-substituted-aminated 5-Ar-2-AIs was synthesized having different n-alkyl and halogen substitutions on the 2N-position and the 4(5)-phenyl ring, respectively. Compounds were evaluated for their biofilm inhibitory activity against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and MRSA. Additionally, their toxicity was tested on eight continuous cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and Caenorhabditis elegans, along with their genotoxicity on Capan-1. Halogenation and elongation of the n-alkyl substituent showed a positive effect on biofilm inhibitory activity, but also increased toxicity. Compromising between activity and toxicity, a non-halogenated 2N-substituted-aminated 5-Ar-2-AI compound with an intermediate n-heptyl substitution demonstrated promising broad-spectrum biofilm inhibition, making it a suitable candidate for further research in anti-infectious medical applications.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the ten major factors threatening human life and health. At present, many factors limit the application of existing anti-tuberculosis drugs, such as a small range of available drug options, poor treatment compliance, and severe toxic and side effects. It is extremely urgent to develop novel anti-tuberculosis drugs. DprE1 is a potential anti-mycobacterial cell wall target, and some DprE1 inhibitors have entered the clinical research stage. Our research group found DprE1 inhibitor G50 with similar activity as isoniazid through virtual screening in the early stage. To obtain better DprE1 inhibitors, 45 new compounds were designed and synthesized based on the structure of G50. Among them, 12 selected DprE1 enzyme inhibitors could significantly inhibit the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) H37Ra and H37Rv growth in vitro. The MIC

AB  - The prevalence of MDR Gram-negative bacteria has posed a great impetus for the discovery of new therapeutic approaches. Here, we synthesized a series of pyrylium derivatives as antibiotic adjuvants based on IMB-0042, and evaluated their activities against Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Compound 4a significantly synergized polymyxin B in combating A. baumannii and E. coli both in vitro and on the infected Galleria mellonella models. Furthermore, we identified 4a to be an effective perturbant of the Gram-negative outer membrane (OM) through the blockage on LptA/LptC interaction via targeting Met47 in LptA. And cationic pyrylium reduced the OM densification by electrostatic interaction with anion-rich lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Thus, pyrylium derivatives constitute a new class of multi-target OM permeabilizers, which can significantly potentiate antibiotics against MDR Gram-negative bacteria.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High-dose (HD) tigecycline is often required for severe multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections in liver failure patients, despite package recommendations to halve the dose for those with severe liver impairment. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of different tigecycline doses in this population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 192 patients with Child-Pugh grade C liver failure was divided into label-dose (LD), standard-dose (SD), and HD groups. Primary and secondary outcomes included microbial eradication, mortality, and adverse effects. RESULTS: The SD group achieved higher microbial eradication than LD, with comparable efficacy to HD but fewer adverse events, such as fibrinogen requirements. High-dose treatment increased mortality risk (Hazard Ratio: 1.85,  CONCLUSIONS: Standard-dose tigecycline offers a balanced approach to microbial eradication and safety, making it preferable in liver failure patients.

AB  - The armeniaspirol family of antibiotics have been shown to inhibit the ATP-dependent proteases ClpXP and ClpYQ and to disrupt the electrical membrane potential (ΔΨ) bacterial proton motive force. The synthesis and characterization of first generation armeniaspirol analogs shows the N-alkyl group is amenable to modification. Herein we synthesize eleven second generation N-alkyl analogs and show they display excellent antibiotic potency against multiple MRSA strains and retain the ability to disrupt membrane electrical potential. We also show that it is difficult to generate resistant MRSA mutants to these new compounds, making them appealing leads for new antibiotic development.

AB  - The Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 216 nitrogen transformation test is used to understand the impacts of plant protection products (PPPs) on the soil microbiome. However, there is significant interest in developing the European PPP risk assessment to include new technologies such as amplicon sequencing to assess impacts on soil microbial community composition and diversity. We have little understanding of how to generate endpoints from amplicon sequencing data sets, their robustness, and whether they provide an appropriate level of protection to the soil microbiome. Our study addresses this key knowledge gap. We conducted a dose-response OECD 216 study with two chemicals, nitrapyrin and streptomycin, and calculated traditional functional endpoints, in accordance with the OECD 216 guideline, and used amplicon sequencing techniques to generate a range of endpoints based on soil bacterial diversity, richness, dissimilarity from the control, species sensitivity distributions, and threshold indicator analysis. We show it is possible to generate a range of endpoints from amplicon sequencing data sets; however, these endpoints varied significantly based on the calculation method, with up to a 101-fold difference between the least and most sensitive endpoints. Additionally, the relative sensitivity of these endpoints compared to the currently used functional OECD 216 metrics was compound dependent, with many endpoint calculation methods unable to detect the impacts of nitrapyrin on the soil microbiome at concentrations deemed ecotoxicologically relevant by OECD 216. Our study shows amplicon sequencing methods to study soil microbial ecotoxicology did not perform consistently and reliably when considering both nitrapyrin and streptomycin treatments and in many cases did not consistently provide an enhanced degree of protection over the functional OECD 216 assessments already integrated into the PPP risk assessment.

AB  - The Enterovirus genus contains two major subgroups: rhinovirus (RV) species A-C and enterovirus (EV) ones A-D. While RV only infects the respiratory system, the EV can cause a wide variety of diseases, ranging from non-specific febrile illness to severe neurologic complications. To date, no curative treatments are commercially available. Our research team had recently developed EV-A71 inhibitors. To improve their activity and broaden their spectrum, we performed optimization of the structure following an iterative cycle of chemical modulations. As a result, we obtained two broad-spectrum inhibitors with micromolar activity against these 3 types of viruses (OM1260: EC

AB  - Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have increased dramatically in number due to rapid urbanization. However, these facilities release significant amounts of potentially hazardous airborne microorganisms, including Staphylococcus aureus bioaerosol, which poses health risks to employees and nearby residents. Therefore, this study estimated the direct exposure risks of bioaerosols in WWTPs using a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) framework evaluated through sensitivity analysis methods. The results showed that the sludge yard had the highest mean bioaerosol concentration but the lowest aerosolization ratio. The disease health risk burden values followed a descending order: residential area > office > sludge yard > inverted umbrella aeration tank > microporous aeration tank > control room. Meanwhile, the risk values were shrunken by 14.1-17.3 times when personal protective equipment (PPE) was used. Sensitivity analysis for individual and multifarious contributions showed that the removal fraction achieved by using PPE was consistently the most influential parameter, followed by aerosol ingestion rate or exposure concentration. This suggests that isolation strips, such as green belts, between the WWTP and residential area is alternative effective measures for residents and wearing masks is essential measure for on-site employees. Furthermore, the multifarious contribution analysis showed that stepwise risk mitigation approaches were equally effective as one-step solutions, as indicated by their identical sensitivity coefficient rankings. This indicates that, when resources for mitigating risk are limited, taking a stepwise approach to risk reduction can be equally effective as allocating all resources at once. This study can advance the understanding of the characteristics and health risks of WWTP bioaerosol emissions and supplement the multifarious contributions of the sensitivity analysis implemented in the QMRA model, which contributes to public wellness development. The findings of this study will help in the optimization of control strategies for local wastewater utilities and implicated surrounding residents.

AB  - Recurrent respiratory tract infections (RRTIs) are a common condition in pediatrics and significantly impact children's quality of life; however, their pathogenesis and contributing factors are not yet fully elucidated. Probiotics have recently emerged as promising agents for modulating intestinal microecology and have gained considerable attention in clinical research on preventing and treating RRTIs in children. This article provides an initial overview of the concept, classification, and mechanisms underlying probiotics. It emphasizes their beneficial effects on respiratory health by modulating intestinal microbial equilibrium, augmenting immune system functionality, and attenuating inflammatory responses. Subsequently, we examine existing research regarding the use of probiotics in pediatric RRTIs. Numerous clinical trials have unequivocally demonstrated that supplementing with probiotics can significantly reduce both the frequency and severity of RRTIs in children while also simultaneously decreasing antibiotic usage. However, there are ongoing controversies and challenges in current research concerning the influence of probiotic type, dosage, duration of use, and other factors on efficacy. Furthermore, variations have been observed across different studies. Additionally, it is crucial to further evaluate the safety and potential long-term side effects associated with probiotic use in children with RRTIs. In conclusion, we propose future research directions including conducting more high-quality randomized controlled trials to optimize application strategies for probiotics alongside other treatments while considering variations based on age and health conditions among pediatric populations. Finally, in summary although probiotics exhibit promising benefits in preventing and treating RRTIs in children; additional studies are necessary to refine their application strategies ensuring both safety and effectiveness.

AB  - The quest for novel antimicrobials is critical due to emerging resistance by new microorganism strains. In these circumstances, we designed and synthesized a series of β-aminothiochromones by employing an aziridines ring-opening strategy to discover antimicrobial agents that are effective against multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. Structures of the compounds [3(a-m) and 3a(a-o)] were well characterized and confirmed by the spectroscopic, analytical and single crystal X-ray analysis. Further, we conducted the in vitro antimicrobial assessment studies against selected Gram-positive, and Gram-negative bacterial strains and two fungal strains. In preliminary screening, all synthesized compounds exhibited moderate activity compared to tested standard drugs Ampicillin, Ciprofloxacin and Fluconazole wherein, 3 m and 3ae displayed higher anti-microbial activities. In addition, these analogues exhibited anti-angiogenic properties on HepG2 cells. The in-silico studies on promising hits, 3 m and 3ae on proteins DNA gyrase and Topoisomerase IV indicate that these hybrids possess better binding energy in comparison with standard drugs. Thus, based on in vitro and silico studies, the newly synthesized compounds appear to be potential scaffolds for antimicrobial and anti-angiogenic drug discovery initiatives.

AB  - In this article, a series of calix[4]arenes derivatized with isatin derivatives at the phenolic-O position were synthesized as potential theranostic molecules for antitumor therapy. The cytotoxic mechanism of action of the synthesized compounds was determined by Alamar Blue assay and flow cytometry using MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, DLD1, HeLa and A549 human cancer cell lines and their ability to penetrate into PNT1A healthy epithelial cells. To detect DNA damage, the Comet test was applied after the synthesized compounds interacted with the cells. As a result, it was found that treated cells had abnormal tail nuclei and damaged DNA structures compared with untreated cells. Within the scope of enzyme inhibition experiments, studies were carried out on aromatase and COX-2 enzymes and it was determined that the compounds in the series showed inhibitory activity at varying rates. Especially compounds CLX-A3, CLX-A4, CLX-B3 and CLX-B5 attract attention with their enzyme inhibitor potential. Also, the antioxidant activities of the compounds whose synthesis was completed were also investigated and it was observed that the examined derivatives also had antioxidant activity potential. As a result of the antibacterial and antifungal test performed with broth microdilution, it was observed that the compounds had significant antibacterial and antifungal activity. The lowest MIC values were recorded as 0.006 mg/ml against Sarcina lutea and 0.048 against Candida albicans. In addition, the compound CLX-B3was observed to be effective against all strains including, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella enteritidis (Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria).

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) continues to pose a significant public health challenge worldwide. Hydrazide-containing compounds have demonstrated considerable potential as anti- tubercular agents. In this study, we designed, synthesized, and evaluated a series of chroman- Schiff base derivatives, integrating a chroman scaffold with substituted phenyl moieties, as potential therapeutic candidates against TB. In silico studies were conducted to assess the binding interactions of the synthesized derivatives, specifically their R- and S-isomers, with the tuberculosis target protein InhA (PDB ID: 1ZID). Molecular docking revealed that two R-isomer derivatives, SM-5A and SM-6A, exhibited superior binding affinities (-10.6 kcal/mol) compared to the reference ligand INH-NADH (-10.3 kcal/mol) and the natural substrate NADH (-7.5 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the long-term stability of these compound-protein complexes over a 100 ns trajectory, further substantiating their potential as stable inhibitors. The structures of the synthesized derivatives were validated using spectroscopic techniques, including FTIR,

AB  - Bioaerosol emissions during toilet flushing are an often-overlooked source of potential health risks in shared public facilities. This study systematically investigated the emission characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli bioaerosols in washrooms with squat and bidet toilets under varying flushing conditions and ventilation scenarios. Using Monte Carlo simulation-based quantitative microbial risk assessment and sensitivity analysis, the study estimated the disease burden and identified key factors influencing risk. The results showed that squat toilets generated 1.7-2.6 times higher concentrations of S. aureus bioaerosols and 1.2-1.4 times higher concentrations of E. coli bioaerosols compared to bidet toilets. After the first flush, bioaerosol concentrations were 1.3-1.8 times (S. aureus) and 1.2-1.4 times (E. coli) lower than those observed after the second flush. The second flush released a higher proportion of fine bioaerosol particles (<4.7 µm), increasing inhalation risks. The disease health risk burden was consistently one order of magnitude lower after the first flush than the second one. Ventilation with a turned-on exhaust fan further reduced the risk by one order of magnitude. Sensitivity analysis identified exposure concentration as the most influential parameter, contributing up to 50% of the overall risk. This study highlights the importance of optimizing toilet design and ventilation systems to mitigate bioaerosol emissions and associated health risks. It provides actionable insights for improving public washroom hygiene and minimizing bioaerosol exposure.

AB  - Small organic molecules are compounds that are manufactured through chemical synthesis. One of the key advantages of small molecules is that they have a low molecular weight and simple chemical structures. This allows more predictability to their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, which means that dosing is simpler. To use small molecules as a useful tool to address human health issues, the collaboration between disciplines, especially chemistry and biology, is essential. In recent years in our laboratories, we have demonstrated that climacostol, a 5-alkenyl resorcinolic produced by eukaryotic microorganisms as secondary metabolite and obtained by our synthetic strategy too, it shows important biological and pharmacological activities. These ones are highly dependent on the 5-alkenyl chain, and chemical modifications to the resorcinolic moiety can be exploited to achieve higher toxicity against pathogen microbes and protists than climacostol. In this study, we have designed and made a synthetic strategy for a new analogue of climacostol (AN3), and evaluated how the new hydroxyl group at position four in the aromatic ring influences its biological effects on prokaryotic and free-living protists and on non-target cells/organisms, especially with regard to cytotoxic properties.

AB  - This study was conducted to determine the total antioxidant capacity (TAC), anti-quorum sensing (QS) potential, and anticancer activity of extracts obtained from Berberis crataegina fruits by the maceration method. Moreover, the mode of action for the antioxidant activity was explored by molecular modeling. For this purpose, we performed 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and cupric ion reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) methods to measure the antioxidant ability of the extracts. The total phenolic content (TPC) of the extracts was determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The cytotoxic activity of the crude extracts on the A549 lung cancer cell line was evaluated using the MTT assay. The TAC values of the extract were found to vary between 0.744 and 1.763 mmol TE/g-extract for FRAP, CUPRAC, and DPPH assays. The TPC of extract was determined as 80.76 mg GAE/g. Extract induced inhibition of virulence factors elastase and pyocyanine by 85.8% and 57%, respectively. Results provided evidence that the extracts exhibited significant cytotoxicity against A549 human lung cancer cells with an IC

AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous studies suggest that morellic acid (MOR), highly available in Garcinia plants, has different physiological activities, including anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, and anti-microbial activity. AIM: In this investigation, we aimed to demonstrate the anxiolytic activity, along with the mechanism behind this activity of MOR, using in vivo and in silico studies. METHODS: For this, we used different doses of MOR (5 and 10 mg/kg) and administered this drug intraperitoneally to Swiss albino mice (male and female). Diazepam (DZP), a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA RESULTS: This investigation revealed that MOR remarkably reduced the locomotor activity of mice in a dose-dependent manner and produced calming behaviors like DZP. However, the findings showed that the combination of MOR and DZP synergistically reduced the locomotion of mice compared to the single therapy. On the other hand, from the computational study, the result demonstrated that MOR exhibited the highest binding scores (-9.2 kcal/mol) towards the GABA CONCLUSION: However, it is recommended that more precise and comprehensive preclinical investigations be required to demonstrate the exact mechanism behind the anxiolytic effects and conduct clinical trials to determine efficacy and safety.

AB  - Toxoplasma gondii is an important foodborne pathogen. The aim of this study was to develop a tissue cyst-based quantitative risk assessment model to estimate the probability of human infection with T. gondii from consuming pork in Denmark. A 'farm-to-fork' model was developed to trace the path of T. gondii infection, beginning with the true seroprevalence in pigs and proceeding to the estimation of tissue cysts in portions of pork. The model then accounted for the number of infectious portions post preparation and prior to consumption. Thereafter, the model estimated the probability of human infection from consumption of infectious portions using a dose-response model. The model predicted the prevalence of T. gondii infections in humans, with the assumption that infections did not equate clinical illness. The average estimated prevalence at the age of 75 years ranged from 58.8% to 88.8%, depending on specific model scenarios. Furthermore, the predicted prevalence was higher for portions originating from conventionally raised pigs compared to those from organic pigs. This was due to the significantly higher proportion of consumption of conventional pork compared to organic pork, and despite the per-portion risk being higher for organic pork. The model identified that undercooked pork, dry-cured sausages, and smoked products pose a risk of infection. The probabilities of human infection per portion consumed were estimated at 7.3 × 10⁻⁴, 4.7 × 10⁻⁴, and 1.2 × 10⁻

In this context, a new series of quaternized fused β-carbolines was synthesized and evaluated for its anti-bacterial potential. Several compounds from the series displayed potent anti-bacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria including the drug-resistant strains with minimal cytotoxicity and promising bactericidal action.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced from microbial fermentation of non-digestible carbohydrates and protein have been shown to modulate adipocyte adipokine secretion and metabolic function, which has implications for mitigating dysfunction in obese adipose tissue; however, the individual effects of different SCFAs and the optimal concentration required is unknown. The purpose of this study was to dose-dependently determine the effects of individual SCFAs on adipocyte adipokine secretion and metabolic function. METHODS: We recapitulated the obese adipocyte inflammatory conditions using mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes and a physiological concentration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) ± individual SCFAs, namely acetate, propionate, and butyrate, in a dose-dependent manner (0.25 mM, 0.5 mM, and 1 mM) for 24 h. RESULTS: SCFAs dose-dependently affected inflammatory adipokine secretion, wherein at 1 mM, all three SCFAs reduced the secretion of leptin, IL-6 and IL-1β, but only propionate and butyrate reduced MCP-1/CCL2 and MIP-1α/CCL3 compared to control ( CONCLUSIONS: Individual SCFAs exert different dose-dependent effects on LPS-stimulated adipocyte function.

AB  - A series of novel thiazole-pleuromutilin derivatives were designed and synthesized, and their antibacterial activities were evaluated. Most of the synthesized derivatives showed good activity against Gram-positive bacteria, among which compound h19 was more prominent and had the strongest antibacterial activity against MRSA. Compound h19 was selected for further evaluation of bacterial time-kill kinetics, and the results demonstrated its highly promising efficacy in inhibiting MRSA growth. Moreover, h19 exhibited a superior post-antibiotic effect (PAE) value and a lower possibility for bacterial resistance development compared to tiamulin. Docking studies demonstrated the strong affinity of h19 for the 50S ribosomal subunit with a binding free energy of -10.6 kcal/mol. The cytotoxic assay indicated that h19 had low cytotoxicity on both HEK293T and HepG2 cells (IC

AB  - The development of innovative antiviral strategies is critical to address the global health threats posed by RNA viruses, including the Zika virus (ZIKV), which can cause severe neurological complications. The lipid transporter Oxysterol Binding Protein (OSBP), essential for cholesterol and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate trafficking, is exploited by many positive-strand RNA viruses, making it an attractive novel antiviral target. This study investigates simplified analogues of macarangin B, a natural compound with potent OSBP-targeted antiviral activity against ZIKV, but limited stability due to its flavonol moiety. A series of analogues was synthesized, replacing the flavonol with a flavone core while retaining the essential hexahydroxanthene (HHX) motif. These compounds demonstrated improved stability (t

Herein, 37 furazanoazepines derivatives were efficiently synthesized and their antifungal activities against four phytopathogenic fungi were investigated to obtain many effective compounds. Notably, compound 4h was found to exhibited excellent in vitro and in vivo activity against Alternaria alternata, which was obviously better than the positive control osthole. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) study revealed that compound 4h could cause significant morphological damage of hyphae. Molecular docking indicated that compound 4h could interact with succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) by forming hydrogen bond with the Leu305 residue at the active site.

AB  - SIGNIFICANCE: Chronic or surgical wound infections in healthcare remain a worldwide problem without satisfying options. Systemic or topical antibiotic use is an inadequate solution, given the increase in antimicrobial-resistant microbes. Hence, antibiotic-free alternatives are needed. Antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (aPDI) has been shown to be effective in wound disinfection. Among the impediments to the wide utility of aPDI for wounds is the high variability in reported photosensitizer and light dose to be effective and unintentional detrimental impact on the wound closure rates. Additionally, the time required by the healthcare professional to deliver this therapy is excessive in the present form of delivery. AIM: We reviewed the dose ranges for various photosensitizers required to achieve wound disinfection or sterilization while not unintentionally inhibiting wound closure through concomitant photobiomodulation (PBM) processes. APPROACH: To allow comparison of aPDI or PBM administered doses, we employ a unified dose concept based on the number of absorbed photons per unit volume by the photosensitizer or cytochrome C oxidase for aPDI and PBM, respectively. RESULTS: One notes that for current aPDI protocols, the absorbed photons per unit volume for wound disinfection or sterilization can lead to inhibiting normal wound closure through PBM processes. CONCLUSION: Options to reduce the dose discrepancy between effective aPDI and PBM are discussed.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of dietary glutamine (Gln) supplementation on the performance, carcass characteristics, blood biochemistry, intestinal morphology, and gut microbiota of laying quail over a 12-week period, with analyses conducted after 6 and 12 weeks of supplementation. Seven-week-old dual-purpose female quails at the onset of laying were assigned to diets containing 0% (control), 0.5%, 1%, or 1.5% Gln. Performance metrics included laying rate, daily feed intake, and feed efficiency. Supplementation with 0.5% Gln significantly enhanced the laying rate after 12 weeks; daily feed intake and feed efficiency varied over time but were not consistently affected by Gln. Breast muscle weight was highest in quail supplemented with 1.5% Gln after 6 weeks. Blood serum analyses showed that total protein and albumin concentrations were highest in quail receiving 0% and 1% Gln after 12 weeks, while supplementation with 0.5% Gln decreased triacylglycerol levels after 12 weeks. Glucose and creatinine levels varied with Gln supplementation and between the two time points; enzyme activities (alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase) were affected by both Gln dose and length of supplementation. Intestinal morphology was significantly influenced by Gln dose and supplementation period. The longest villi were observed in quail supplemented with 1% Gln after 6 weeks, decreasing by 12 weeks. The widest villi were recorded in quail receiving 1.5% Gln after 6 weeks, with villus width decreasing over time. Crypt depth varied significantly, with the deepest crypts observed at 6 weeks in quail supplemented with 1% and 1.5% Gln, becoming shallower after 12 weeks. Microbial analysis of digesta samples revealed Lactobacillaceae as the predominant bacterial family, followed by Enterobacteriaceae and genera including Streptococcus and Staphylococcus. Overall, dietary Gln supplementation influenced performance, carcass characteristics, blood biochemical parameters, intestinal morphology, and gut microbiota composition in laying quail, with effects varying between 6 and 12 weeks of supplementation. These findings suggest that Gln supplementation has the potential to enhance quail performance and health over time.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of calcium butyrate (CB) and bacitracin methylene disalicylate 50 (BMD) combined with different phytase concentrations on broiler intestinal health and physiology. Day-old YPM x Ross 708 male broilers (2,880) were distributed in 72 floor pens and assigned to 1 of 9 treatments (8 replicates/treatment). This experiment was a factorial arrangement including 2 phytase concentrations (500 or 1,500 FTU/kg) and 4 microbiota modulating feed additive levels (MMFA; (1) none, (2) only CB (0.5 g/kg of diet), (3) only BMD (55 mg/kg of diet), or (4) both CB and BMD). Additionally, a negative control without phytase and MMFA was included. Intestinal permeability was assessed on d 27. Jejunum wall and cecal content samples were collected on d 28 and 42 to assess jejunum villus height (VH), crypt depth, tight-junction and mucin gene expression, cecal microbiome diversity, and predicted bacterial metabolic pathways. Phytase and MMFA did not influence intestinal permeability (P > 0.05). Combining both CB and BMD with 1,500 FTU/kg of phytase compared to 500 FTU/kg lowered d 28 VH (P ≤ 0.05). Jejunal expression of CL-1, CL-4, CL-5, and ZO-2 on d 28 as well as CL-2 on d 42 changed between MMFA when combined with 1,500 FTU/kg of phytase but not 500 FTU/kg (P ≤ 0.05). Day 42 Pielou's evenness increased when 1,500 FTU/kg of phytase was combined with both CB and BMD compared to no MMFA (P ≤ 0.05). The cecal microbial beta diversity was not influenced by phytase, MMFA, or their interaction (P > 0.05). Overall, broiler intestinal health and physiology were influenced by CB and BMD depending on phytase concentration, demonstrating the complex interactions between these feed additives.

AB  - The agricultural bioactivity of 7-alkenylcoumarin derivatives was investigated by synthesizing a series of coumarin derivatives containing 7-styryl fragments by introducing a styryl group at the 7-position of the coumarin scaffold through Pechmann cyclization, substitution, bromination, and Wittig reaction. The insecticidal effects and antifungal activities of these compounds against plant pathogenic fungi were evaluated. Bioactivity assessments revealed that compound 5i exhibited the highest larvicidal activity against Aedes aegypti, with a mortality rate of 96% after 24 h of treatment. Compounds 5i, 5e, and 5a displayed the strongest antifungal activity against Colletotrichum musae, with median effective concentration values of 0.42, 3.44, and 3.67 mg/L, respectively, outperforming the commercial fungicide bromothalonil (9.31 mg/L) and comparable to chlorothalonil (0.74 mg/L). Structure-activity relationship analysis indicated that the presence of a chlorine atom at the 4-position of the phenyl ring was critical for the bioactivity of the compounds. Docking results indicated that compound 5i exhibited the strongest binding affinity for succinate dehydrogenase, providing insights for further mechanistic studies. These findings suggest the significant potential of these compounds as lead candidates for in-depth research and development.

This study investigated the occurrence of VBNC Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in source water, tap water, and potable water in eastern China, using propidium monoazide-quantitative PCR and culture-based methods. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed based on conventional water quality indicators to predict VBNC pathogen concentrations. The results indicated that drinking water treatment plants effectively reduced VBNC pathogens by 1-3 log units, however, concentrations ranging from 10

AB  - Globally, human norovirus (HuNoV) is the leading cause of foodborne illnesses. Norovirus transmission to fresh produce can occur via several sources, including contaminated irrigation water. HuNoV RNA has been detected in freshwater resources, but knowledge about virus infectivity is limited due to a historical lack of a HuNoV cell culture. Recently, HuNoV was shown to replicate in human intestinal enteroids (HIE). The objective of this study was to use HIE to evaluate the persistence of infectious HuNoV in raw (i.e. biologically active) surface freshwater. The virus was spiked into freshwater microcosms sampled from three freshwater ponds and then incubated inside an environmental chamber at 20-15 °C and 50-80 % relative humidity (day-night) and 12 h photoperiod. The water was tested for infectious HuNoV, intact HuNoV capsids, indigenous bacteria, and other water quality parameters over a period of 2 weeks. The persistence of infectious HuNoV in the three freshwater microcosms ranged from ≤1 day to ≥7 days. Decay rates for RNA from intact HuNoV capsids ranged from 0.04 to 0.54/day, predicting a 4.2 to 57.5 days, respectively for 1 log reduction. The intact virus showed a significant negative and positive linear relationship with indigenous bacteria and dissolved oxygen, respectively. Using multiple logistic regression, HuNoV RNA >4.4 log genomic equivalent/ml (Cycle threshold values <32) predicted higher probability of detecting infectious HuNoV in contaminated raw freshwater using HIE. Overall, our results provide valuable insights for enhancing quantitative microbial risk assessment models for pre-harvest agricultural water to understand the public health risks associated with the detection of HuNoV RNA in freshwater.

AB  - Twelve secondary metabolites, including two undescribed steroids, aspesterols A (1) and B (2) and three new triterpenoids, aspertrinoids A-C (5-7), were isolated from the endophytic fungus Aspergillus sp. NB12 obtained from Hypericum patulum. Structurally, aspertrinoids A-C (5-7) were 30-norlanostane triterpenoids with a C9 side-chain moiety and a hemiacetal moiety formed between C-3 and C-19. Their structures were determined through NMR, HRESIMS, X-ray diffraction analyses, and ECD calculations. The activity screening suggested that aspesterols A (1) and B (2) act as quorum sensing inhibitors against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and they not only reduce the mutation frequency of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa but also avoid the development of bacterial drug resistance. It is worth noting that 1 and 2 demonstrated synergy with imipenem at a concentration of 12.5 μM (24 h). Thus, compounds 1 and 2 are potential compounds for dealing with carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

AB  - With global climate change, treated-wastewater irrigation and manure amendment are becoming increasingly important in sustainable agriculture in water- and nutrient-stressed regions. Yet, these practices can potentially disseminate pathogens and antimicrobial resistance determinants to crops, resulting in serious health risks to humans through the food chain. Previous studies demonstrated that pathogen and antimicrobial resistance indicators from wastewater and manure survive poorly in the environment, suggesting that ecological barriers prevent their dissemination. However, we recently found that these elements can persist below detection levels in low quality treated wastewater-irrigated soil, and potentially proliferate under favorable conditions. This "under-the-radar" phenomenon was further investigated here, in treated wastewater-irrigated and poultry litter-amended lettuce plants, using an enrichment platform that resembles gut conditions, and an analytical approach that combined molecular and cultivation-based techniques. Enrichment uncovered clinically relevant multidrug-resistant pathogen indicators and a myriad of antibiotic resistance genes in the litter amended and treated wastewater-irrigated lettuce that were not detected by direct analyses, or in the enriched freshwater irrigated samples. Selected resistant E. coli isolates were capable of horizontally transferring plasmids carrying multiple resistance genes to a susceptible strain. Overall, our study underlines the hidden risks of under-the-radar pathogen and antimicrobial resistance determinants in anthropogenically affected agroenvironments, providing a platform to improve quantitative microbial risk assessment models in the future.

AB  - Microbial-based cleaning products (MBCPs) are an emerging class of cleaning products that contain viable microorganisms, often bacteria or bacterial endospores, as intentionally added formulation ingredients for cleaning and/or odor control. Although several well-established methodologies exist to support risk analysis for conventional chemical-based cleaning products, at present there are no widely recognized methods or commonly utilized frameworks to support risk analysis for use of microbial ingredients present in MBCPs, specifically. The purpose of this work is to provide information to MBCP manufacturers and regulators that can be used to assist in developing their own approaches to MBCP risk assessment. As part of this assessment, potential hazards associated with use of bacterial or bacterial endospore ingredients of MBCPs can be adequately characterized, assessed, and managed as part of both product development and ongoing product stewardship. Accordingly, this document summarizes potential approaches to support strain-level identification of microbial ingredient(s), evaluate their hazards and potential for human exposure, and assess their potential effects following such exposures to different human populations. Recommendations for both hazard and risk characterization are discussed. Additionally, guidance is provided to support decision-making by risk managers, including guidance for the development of risk communication strategies, where appropriate, to mitigate the identified risks. Properly applied, the conceptual approaches described herein may facilitate the standardization and more consistent application of appropriate risk analysis procedures tailored to suit microbial ingredients present in MBCPs. Beyond their utility in assessing microbial ingredients commonly used in MBCPs today, these same approaches may help companies and regulators consider and manage risks for new microbial ingredients that may be utilized in future MBCP formulations.

AB  - Chitin synthase (CHS), as crucial antifungal target, plays a pivotal role in the fungal proliferation and invasion processes. This study constructed pharmacophore models based on ligand and receptor features. These models were used to guide the construction of novel CHS inhibitors via the scaffold-growth pathway. The corresponding molecular structures were synthesized, and their biological activities were evaluated. Among them, compounds 9c, 9e, and 9f exhibited significant inhibitory activity against chitin synthesis, achieving high potent antifungal effect. Furthermore, the potential compound 9f, in combination with immune activators, could accelerate the recovery rate of drug-resistant fungal infections in vivo. This study not only successfully established scientific pharmacophore models but also discovered novel CHS inhibitors, opening up a potential new pathway for effectively treating fungal infections by regulating chitin synthesis pathways.

AB  - The filamentous temperature-sensitive protein Z (FtsZ) plays a vital role in bacterial division, making it an important antibacterial target. The inhibitor activity targeting the cleft between the H7 helix and the C-terminal substructural domain exhibited superior binding compared to the GTP binding site. This highlights the potential of the cleft as a promising target for further inhibitor discovery. In this study, we established a virtual screening (VS) pipeline using Discovery Studio software and employed FRED for molecular docking and Functional-Class Fingerprints_6 (FCFP_6) for molecular clustering, resulting in the identification of 38 potentially active compounds. These 38 compounds were then subjected to the following FtsZ inhibition assays, resulting in the four active compounds B6, B21, B26, and B31. Further experiments showed that compounds B6 and B26 exhibited antimicrobial activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 8 and 32 µg/mL. Finally, molecular dynamics (MD) was used to analyze the binding modes of the protein-ligand. In addition, we predicted the physicochemical properties and toxicity of B6 and B26. In summary, our study successfully identified novel FtsZ inhibitors with antimicrobial activity through VS and in vitro biological evaluation, demonstrating their potential for further investigation.

AB  - Creatine plays an important role in regulating intestinal epithelial cell energy metabolism, epithelial integrity, and intestinal barrier function. In this study, three feeds with varying creatine concentrations (0 %, 0.5 %, and 4 %, labeled CR0, CR0.5, and CR4, respectively) were formulated and administered to juvenile largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) for 8 weeks. Creatine-containing diets significantly improved growth performance and intestinal villus height. Microbiota analysis revealed that creatine-containing diets changed the beta diversity of gut microbes and increased the relative proportion of Cetobacterium. Enteritis was induced for 7 days using the corresponding feeds containing creatine and 2 % DSS (labeled CR0, DCR0, DCR0.5, and DCR4). Enteritis resulted in an increase in hif1α expression in the DCR0.5 and DCR4 groups and a significant increase expression of creatine transporter SLC6A8. QPCR and Western blotting of intestinal barrier-related genes (e.g., Claudin1, Claudin4, and ZO1), MUC2 immunohistochemistry, and PAS mucus staining were used to show intestinal barrier status, these results suggest that dietary creatine attenuates the extent of intestinal barrier damage. After TUNEL and KI67 immunofluorescence analyses of the intestine and detection of the expression of relevant genes at the protein and transcript levels, the results showed that dietary addition of creatine significantly alleviated intestinal apoptosis and cellular inflammatory responses due to DSS-induced enteritis. These findings indicate long-term dietary supplementation with creatine modulated the microbial composition of the intestinal lumen of juvenile largemouth bass, promoted intestinal health, and improved anti-inflammatory properties following enteritis induction. This study provides a theoretical foundation for largemouth bass feed formulation optimization and fish enteritis control.

AB  - Herein we describe efficient and cost-effective synthesis of azo-based and aminomethylene derivatives of cyclic β-keto sulfones, specifically, 4,4-disubstituted (E)-2-(2-phenylhydrazineylidene)dihydrothiophen-3(2H)-one 1,1-dioxides and 4,4-disubstituted (E)-2-((methylamino)methylene)dihydrothiophen-3(2H)-one 1,1-dioxides. The azo-based derivatives were prepared through the azo coupling of cyclic β-keto sulfones with aromatic diazonium acetates, in situ prepared by diazotization of appropriate substituted amino benzenes. The aminomethylene derivatives were synthesized through the condensation of cyclic β-keto sulfones with DMF-DMA followed by a transamination reaction with primary amines. The target products were obtained in good yields and their structure was unambiguously established based on NMR spectra data, X-ray diffraction study, and DFT calculations. These compounds were designed as cost-effective and multitarget biologically active compounds. Further in vitro study showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and cytotoxicity against the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line without affecting non-malignant cells MAEC. The molecular docking study confirmed good binding affinity of the studied compounds for DHPS, crucial for the bacterial life cycle and for CLK4 and IDO1, which are the therapeutic targets in cancer treatment.

AB  - Vancomycin intermediate-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) is a pathogen of concern. VraS, a histidine kinase, facilitates the VISA phenotype. Here, we reveal a benzoxazolyl urea (chemical 1) that directly inhibits VraS and enhances vancomycin to below the clinical breakpoint against an archetypal VISA strain, Mu50. 50 μM of 1 enhances vancomycin 16-fold to 0.25 μg/mL. The MIC of oxacillin is enhanced 32-fold to 8 μg/mL, only slightly above its clinical breakpoint. The chemical also showed promising enhancement of oxacillin against several MRSA strains. 1 shows ∼30 % inhibition of ATPase activity in VraS and reduces vra gene auto-upregulation typical upon vancomycin exposure. Therefore, 1 inhibits VraS to block normal vra operon function, leading to potent enhancement of cell wall-directed antibiotics. Interestingly, a molecular modeling approach suggests 1 does not displace ATP from the active site, but acts elsewhere. While VraS inhibitors have previously been reported to function against MRSA, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first direct VraS inhibitor ever reported that shows significant enhancement of vancomycin against VISA.

AB  - The severe impact of COVID-19 on global health and economies highlights the critical need for innovative treatments. Recently, lapatinib, a drug initially used for breast cancer, has been identified as a potential inhibitor of the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, meriting further investigation. Utilizing rational design strategies and guided by MD simulations, we developed novel aminoquinazoline analogs based on fragmented lapatinib's structure. Preliminary computational screenings identified promising candidates, which were synthesized using a concise 3-4 step process. In vitro assays demonstrated notable antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2-infected cells for all analogs, with Bb1 showing an EC

AB  - Increasing pressures on traditional sources of water have accelerated the adoption of water reuse throughout the world. A key consideration for communities pursuing water reuse is understanding the amount of treatment that is needed to ensure adequate human health protection. Several U.S. EPA documents describe the importance of managing acute microbial risks and highlight the utility of quantitative microbial risk assessment for developing "fit-for-purpose" treatment targets based on the source of water and end-use. However, there are no U.S. federal water reuse regulations and states are currently considering microbial treatment targets for various applications. Previous publications have yet to address this need by using an updated and consistent set of input parameters to present risk-based microbial treatment targets across a wide range of sources of water, end-use applications, and health benchmarks. This work combines the most current modeling inputs and dose-response parameter values to provide probability of infection and disease burden-based microbial treatment targets for untreated municipal wastewater, untreated onsite wastewater, graywater, stormwater, and roof runoff water used for potable reuse, indoor nonpotable use, and landscape irrigation applications.

AB  - Amoxicillin is commonly used to treat erythema migrans in the first stage of Lyme disease in children, with a recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day, administered three times a day (q8h). This model-based simulation study aimed to determine whether splitting the same daily dose into two administrations (q12h) would provide comparable drug exposure. A pharmacokinetic model suitable for a pediatric population (age: 1 month to 18 years, weight: 4-80 kg) was selected through a literature review. Simulations were performed with 15,000 virtual patients receiving 16.67 mg/kg/dose q8h, 25 mg/kg/dose q12h, or other q12h dosing variations. The target therapeutic level was defined by the percentage of time that the unbound drug concentration remained above the minimum inhibitory concentration (% fT > MIC) specific to Borrelia burgdorferi, with MICs of 0.06, 0.25, 1, 2, and 4 mg/L, requiring at least 40% and 50% of time for effective treatment. Probability of target attainment (PTA) was considered acceptable if it exceeded 50%, allowing for comparison of dosing schedules. Results indicated that the 50 mg/kg/day divided q12h regimen provided similar drug exposure to the q8h regimen for MICs below 2 mg/L (PTAs >50%). For a MIC of 2 mg/L, PTA was achieved with a higher dose of 30 mg/kg/dose q12h. However, for a MIC of 4 mg/L, the PTA criterion was not met. These findings suggest that a twice-daily dosing of 25 mg/kg/dose provides comparable bactericidal activity to the thrice-daily regimen for MICs between 0.06 and 1 mg/L. This simplified regimen may improve adherence and treatment implementation in children.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fungal endophytes have mutualistic associations with the plant's host, communicating through genetic and metabolic processes. As a result, they gain the ability to generate therapeutically effective metabolites and their derivatives. METHODS: The current study aims to assess antioxidant potential along with the identification of robust metabolites within the crude extract of a potent endophytic fungus  RESULTS: The extract of ACL-ME-treated HEK 293T cells exhibited significant toxicity, with an IC50 value of 1481.74 ± 23.772 μg/mL, compared to fungal strain ACL-4-treated HEK 293T cells, which had an IC50 value greater than 2000 μg/mL. Consequently, the crude extract of ACL-4 and ACL-ME along with the standard drug methotrexate exhibited cytotoxic activity against cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 with IC50 concentrations of 146.65 ± 0.394 μg/mL, 528.46 ± 10.912 μg/mL, and 134.11 ± 3.446 μg/mL, respectively.

AB  - Infections of multidrug-resistant pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cause a high risk of mortality in immunocompromised patients and underscore the need for novel natural antibacterial drugs. In this study, common phytochemicals prevalent in fruits and vegetables have been demonstrated for their ability to inhibit quorum sensing (QS) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 (PA). Ten compounds were screened virtually by molecular docking, among which, daidzein dimethyl ether originally from Albizzia lebbeck showed the most significant inhibitory effect on the formation of biofilm and the accumulation of virulence factors, including elastase, pyocyanin and rhamnolipid in PA. Further, both qRT-PCR analysis of key QS components including LasR in PA and luminescence detection of LasR as a reporter in a heterologous system revealed that daidzein dimethyl ether at 10 µM significantly inhibited the transcription of lasR and its downstream targeting genes. At the same time, MD simulations also showed that daidzein dimethyl ether could reduce the stability of LasR. Furthermore, the protective effect of daidzein dimethyl ether against PA infection was demonstrated using zebrafish infection model. It was found to reduce significantly the inflammation in the PA-infected zebrafish and increase their survival rate by inhibiting prominently the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reducing fish mortality in PA-infected zebrafish larvae. Additionally, open field tests suggested that PA-infected zebrafish were observed with impaired swimming behaviour, but daidzein dimethyl ether-treatment rescued zebrafish from such swimming abnormalities. Histopathological analysis revealed that zebrafish treated with both PA and daidzein dimethyl ether showed obvious integrity in intestine tissues, compared to those with only PA treatment. This study firstly demonstrated the preventive advantages of daidzein dimethyl ether in an animal model against PA infection. It is worthwhile to explore further its potential therapeutic intervention as an antimicrobial agent.

AB  - Multi-drug-resistant (MDR) pathogens represent a critical global health threat, necessitating the development of novel antimicrobial agents with broad-spectrum activity and minimal toxicity. This study investigates the antimicrobial and anti-biofilm properties of 4-Allyl-2-methoxyphenol (eugenol, EU) and (E)-3-Phenylprop-2-enal (cinnamaldehyde, CN) against 19 clinically significant pathogens through a combination of in-vitro assays and in-silico analyses. EU displayed remarkable activity, particularly against Aspergillus niger (20.5 ± 0.5 mm), and strong binding affinities with key protein targets, including peptide deformylase and β-carbonic anhydrase, with binding free energies (ΔG) ranging from -12.75 to -0.60 kcal/mol. CN exhibited exceptional activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis (29.6 ± 0.4 mm) and Candida albicans (36.6 ± 0.4 mm), supported by a significant binding affinity with β-carbonic anhydrase (ΔG: -5.23 kcal/mol).

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE:  METHODS: In this study, we have evaluated the COMC vaccine further in a dose-response titration of the chlamydial antigen content of the vaccine (from 20 to 2.5 µg in seven experimental groups) using an established pregnant sheep challenge model. RESULTS: No obvious dose-response relationship was observed across the groups, with a single abortion event occurring in four of the groups and three in the lowest dose group (2.5 µg). No abortions occurred in the 15 and 10 µg groups. The abortion rates (0-14%) were significantly below that of the challenge control group (33%). A similar reduction in bacterial shedding of infectious organisms following parturition was observed in the vaccinated groups compared to the challenge control group, which is important in terms of reducing potential transmission to naive animals. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that a dose of 10 µg antigen in the vaccine will be optimal in terms of maximising efficacy, reducing shedding at parturition, and ensuring it is cost-effective to produce for commercial manufacture.

AB  - Pulse flours consisting of isolated cotyledon cells (ICC) have been incorporated in foods with delayed amylolysis. To optimize the cost-benefit ratio, understanding how the dosage of cellular ingredient affects starch digestibility is essential. Therefore, dose-response relationships were established to evaluate the sensitivity of amylolysis kinetics to the inclusion of intact cells in whole common bean-based flours. Conventional raw-milled and innovative cellular flours of Epic red common beans were blended in different proportions, creating a range of blends with varying microstructures. Obtained dose-response relationships were validated for Montcalm red and black bean. For all varieties, an increasing dosage of cellular ingredient decreased amylolysis rates, while not affecting final extents. Bean variety-dependent linear dose-response relationships were established between the fraction of raw-milled flour and amylolysis. Dosages of intact cells decreased the amylolysis rate in a bean-specific manner, creating potential for impacted postprandial responses.

AB  - The reuse of stormwater represents a potential option for meeting water demands in water stressed regions as well as preventing and mitigating diffuse pollution of receiving water bodies. Particularly, the elaboration of a risk management plan for stormwater reuse may help to understand associated environmental and public health risks and design fit-for-purpose water treatment processes. In this work, it is presented an innovative methodology to perform quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) for stormwater reuse by using data simulated by SWMM software. Particularly, 210 rain events were simulated by SWMM after qualitative and quantitative calibration of the sewer network model of the city of Cupra Maritima (Italy) to identify sewer overflows. Obtained concentrations of pathogens (i.e., E. coli, Campylobacter) in overflows from each critical spillway were fitted by theoretical distribution curves. Hence, QMRA for Campylobacter was performed by Monte Carlo simulation and by linking observed overflows to the exposure events of stormwater reuse for the scenario of 1) municipal irrigation, 2) garden irrigation and 3) toilet flushing as defined by the Australian Guideline for water recycling. Furthermore, QMRA analysis was repeated after simulation of sewer overflow treatment by nature-based solution (NBS) with and without disinfection (UV and performic acid - PFA). Stormwater treatments were simulated by applying uniform distributions of expected range of bacteria log removals. Results showed that stormwater treatment by nature-based solution and disinfections (PFA dose of 2.5-5 mg/L) were able to reduce the risk of Campylobacter infection to acceptable level for most of spillways in the three investigated reuse scenarios. In addition, produced data were elaborated to identify critical overflows discharging in bathing water according to the indications of the EU bathing directive.

AB  - Multicomponent reactions have long been recognized as some of the most versatile tools in organic chemistry, with extensive applications in biomedical science and the pharmaceutical industry. In this study, we explored the potential of the Passerini reaction by designing and synthesizing new low molecular mass gelators that can serve as novel formulations for prolonged anesthesia. These gelators address critical issues like poor solubility, low bioavailability, and short plasma half-life, all of which hinder therapeutic efficacy. To further understand the gelation mechanism, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculation for confirming the presence of non-covalent interactions during gel formation. Additionally, we evaluated the antimicrobial properties of the synthesized compounds, aiming to counter the rise of infectious diseases. These innovative antimicrobial agents could offer solutions to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance, which renders many existing therapies ineffective. Overall, this study aims to develop advanced formulations and antimicrobial agents through the Passerini reaction, providing new strategies for treating infections, minimizing side effects, and combating antibiotic resistance.

AB  - Quinolone antibiotics are known for their antibacterial activity by inhibiting the enzyme DNA gyrase. Inspired by their mechanism, new compounds combining 1,4-dihydropyrimidine, a quinolone isostere, with pyridine/pyrimidine rings were synthesized. These derivatives showed antibacterial effects, likely through DNA gyrase inhibition, as supported by molecular docking and dynamics simulations. The synthesized compounds, 2-[(5-cyano-6-oxo-6-(pyridin-4-yl)-1,6-dihydropyrimidin-2-yl]-N-(benzothiazol-2-yl)-acetamide (5a-5g) and 2-[(5-cyano-6-oxo-6-(pyridin-4-yl)-1,6-dihydropyrimidin-2-yl)thio]-N-(thiazol-2-yl)acetamide (6a-6f), were evaluated for antibacterial activity. Compounds 5a, 6b, and 6c demonstrated significant bactericidal effects. Against Escherichia coli, compounds 6b and 6c exhibited minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 1.95 and 0.97 µg/mL, respectively, comparable to the standard drug. Compound 5a also showed strong activity against Escherichia faecalis. DNA gyrase inhibition studies confirmed that 5a, 6b, and 6c inhibit the enzyme, as no supercoiled DNA band was observed. These findings highlight the potential of these compounds as antibacterial agents. Future development could focus on optimizing these structures for enhanced activity, similar to quinolone antibiotics.

AB  - A diversity-oriented collection of furan-2-carboxamides with antibiofilm activity against P. aeruginosa is reported. The design involved the bioisosteric replacement of the labile furanone ring by a furan-2-carboxamide moiety to explore its influence on biological activity. After evaluation, carbohydrazides and triazoles showed significant antibiofilm activity, and 4b resulted in the most remarkable compound (58 % inhibition). Furthermore, treating P. aeruginosa with three active carboxamides reduced some virulence factors (pyocyanin and proteases), confirming the anti-quorum sensing properties of the derivatives and suggesting LasR as a plausible target. Molecular docking proposed that carbohydrazides share a similar binding mode to related furanones inside LasR with an excellent docking score, while higher derivatives diminished in silico affinity.

AB  - Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), often caused by biofilm-forming Staphylococcus aureus, present significant clinical challenges. Skt35, a dioxopiperidinamide derivative of cinnamic acid, was investigated for its potential antibacterial and antibiofilm activities against S. aureus biofilms. The antibacterial effect of Skt35 was assessed using the zone of inhibition and microdilution methods, revealing a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 250 µM. Antibiofilm properties were confirmed through crystal violet assays, scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy, showing significant biofilm inhibition at the Sub-MIC. In an in vitro bladder model, Skt35-coated silicone catheter tubes exhibited significant antiadhesive effects. Zebrafish embryo tests indicated no toxicity at concentrations up to 125 µM. Molecular docking and simulation analysis revealed strong binding affinities of Skt35 to Accessory Gene Regulator A (-7.9 kcal/mol) and Lux Small protein (-4.96 kcal/mol), suggesting potential disruption of quorum sensing and gene expression in S. aureus, making it a promising candidate for catheter coatings to prevent CAUTIs.

AB  - Cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is the key second messenger regulating bacterial biofilm formation related genes. Several c-di-GMP analogues have demonstrated biofilm inhibition activity. In this study, ribose-phosphate macrocyclic skeleton containing 1'-azido groups was constructed, and CDN analogues were prepared via click chemistry. The biofilm formation inhibition activity of the analogues was evaluated, and compound 17 illustrated better activity than c-di-GMP. This high-throughput strategy could be extended to synthesize cyclic analogues for biological research and immunotherapeutic development.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of reducing inorganic trace minerals (ITM) by supplementing compound organic trace minerals (OTM) chelates on growth performance, fecal mineral excretion, intestinal health, and cecal microbiota of yellow-feathered broilers. A total of 960 one day old male broilers were randomly assigned to 6 treatments, among which birds were fed with the basal diets (negative control, NC), or supplemented with 1,000 mg/kg (positive control, PC), 300, and 500 mg/kg ITM or OTM, respectively. Dietary supplementation of OTM significantly increased the average daily gain (ADG) during 22-53 d and 1-53 d, and reduced the fecal emissions of Fe, Cu, Zn, and Mn of Chinese yellow-feathered broilers (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the OTM300 group significantly reduced the crypt depth in the duodenum, and increased the ratio of villus height to crypt depth (V/C) in the duodenum and jejunum (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression of TGF-β, Bcl-2, CAT, and GPX4 as well as tight junction proteins (occludin, ZO-1, claudin-1, and claudin-5) in jejunum mucosa were significantly increased by compound OTM when comparing with ITM300 group (P < 0.05). Moreover, dietary compound OTM significantly changed the Chao1 index and β diversity index of cecal microbiota of Chinese yellow-feathered broilers. The abundances of Firmicutes (phylum), Eubacterium_coprostanoligenes_group (family) and Oscillibacter (genus) were increased, while the abundances of Bacteroidetes (phylum) and Rikenellaceae RC9 group (genus) were decreased by OTM treatment. Spearman correlation analysis showed that the mRNA of occludin and jejunal V/C ratio were positively correlated with the abundance of Firmicutes (phylum), but negatively correlated with the abundance of Bacteroidota (phylum). In addition, the abundance of Eubacterium_coprostanoligenes_group (family) was positively correlated with the mRNA of claudin-1, Bcl-2, and TGF-β. PICRUST prediction of microbial function revealed that OTM treatment enriched the pathways related to amino acid metabolism and DNA replication. In conclusion, dietary supplementation at lower levels of compound OTM to replace ITM could improve growth performance and intestinal health, and reduce the fecal excretion of trace elements by modulation of cecal microbiota community and diversity in Chinese yellow-feathered broilers.

AB  - Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) play crucial disinfectant roles in healthcare, industry, and domestic settings. Most commercially utilized QACs like benzalkonium chloride have a common architectural theme, leading to a rise in bacterial resistance and urgent need for novel structural classes. Some potent QACs such as chlorhexidine (CHX) and octenidine (OCT) feature a bolaamphiphilic architecture, comprised of two cationic centers at the molecular periphery and a non-polar region connecting them; these compounds show promise to elude bacterial resistance mechanisms. Inspired by such structures, we synthesized a series of 43 biscationic amphiphilic compounds focused on a resorcinol core, featuring flexibility of linker lengths, alkyl tails, and relative substituent positioning, to study their structure activity relationships (SARs). Antibacterial activity evaluation against a panel of gram-positive and gram-negative strains, including ESKAPE pathogens (A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa), were encouraging, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.5-4 μM against all tested strains for select compounds. Ten prepared compounds bearing either 17 or 18 total side chain carbons demonstrated uniformly strong antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa (MIC 4-16 μM) and 6 other strains (MIC ≤4 μM), irrespective of cationic spacing. These findings promise to further extend the application of bolaamphiphilic QACs as a novel class of disinfectants.

AB  - Safe drinking water is key to individual and community health. Water safety is often evaluated based on whether or not a community's drinking water meets the quality standards specified by a governing authority. These water quality standards address many microbial and chemical water safety risks but may not capture risks that are difficult to quantify or community-specific needs and preferences. Water safety planning, first introduced by the World Health Organization, is a more holistic approach that aims to integrate water system stakeholders, system mapping, hazard identification and matrices to better characterise risk. In this study, we documented previous efforts to apply water WSPs in Arctic jurisdictions and evaluated existing risk scoring systems for potential application to Nunavut, an Arctic territory in Canada. The observations from the evaluation informed the development of a preliminary WSP framework for Nunavut which considers both past frequency and the existing hazard barriers in place when determining the likelihood score.

AB  - The expanding prevalence of microbial resistance to conventional treatments has triggered a race to develop alternative/improved strategies to combat drug-resistant microorganisms in an efficient manner. Here, the lethal impact of the biosynthesized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) against multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria has been elucidated. AuNPs, synthesized from the extracts of the fruit, leaf and peel of the Citrus maxima plant, were physicochemically characterized by UV-Vis spectrophotometry, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), electron microscopy and spectroscopic techniques not only confirmed the production of AuNPs of size below 100 nm but also identified the phytochemicals adsorbed onto the surface of NPs. AuFeNP not only showed excellent antioxidant activity (∼95 % at 1 mg/mL) but also exhibited a commendable antimicrobial activity against MDR-Pseudomonas aeruginosa as assessed by the zone of inhibition (13.5 mm) and microwell broth dilution assays (9.5 μg/mL, MIC). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) displayed bacterial cell membrane destruction post-AuNPs exposure. The killing mechanism of AuNPs elucidated the permeabilization of the cell membrane and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), ∼10-fold high depletion of GSH, and eventually leaching protein out of the cell. DNA damage, as a marker of apoptosis, was also noticed, which could be an implication of ROS accumulation in MDR-PA. AuNPs displayed significant toxicity at ∼ 10 μg/mL on various cancer cells (HT-1080, MRC-5, MDA-MB-231 and B16-F10) and relatively low toxicity on normal cells (MRC-5 and HaCaT). Scratch assay to identify the migration capability of breast cancer cells on treatment with AuNPs deciphered hampering of migration potential of breast cancer cells. Apoptotic topographies in B16-F10 cells were confirmed using AO/EtBr dual dye staining, DNA fragmentation, Caspase-3 assay and cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry. Hemolysis revealed minimal toxicity of AuNPs on human red blood cells. Nominal toxicity (∼70 % survival at 500 μg/mL of AuNPs) on mammalian cells was evaluated using Cell Titer-Glo cell viability assay. Overall results advocate the promising potential of biosynthetic AuFeNP against multi-drug-resistant pathogens and for further formulation into anticancer agents.

AB  - p-phenylenediamine antioxidants (PPDs) are extensively used in rubber manufacturing for their potent antioxidative properties, but PPDs and 2-anilino-5-[(4-methylpentan-2yl)amino]cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione (6PPDQ) pose potential environmental and health risks. Existing biomonitoring methods for assessing human exposure to PPDs are labor-intensive, costly, and provide limited data. Thus, there is a critical need to develop predictive models for evaluating PPDs and 6PPDQ exposure levels to facilitate health risk assessments. In this study, machine learning (ML) models were developed to predict the concentration of three PPDs and 6PPDQ in human urine samples. A total of 759 participants from three cities in Zhejiang Province, China, provided urine samples, which were analyzed for PPDs and 6PPDQ concentrations using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Eight ML models were employed to predict PPDs and 6PPDQ concentrations based on demographic and environmental exposure factors such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and occupation. N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD) was the most frequently detected PPD (mean 3.03 ng/mL, range < LOD-18.65 ng/mL), followed by 6PPDQ (mean 2.76 ng/mL, range < LOD-20.85 ng/mL) and N-phenyl-N'-cyclohexyl-p-phenylenediamine (mean 2.04 ng/mL, range < LOD-10.22 ng/mL). Random forest model demonstrated the highest accuracy in predicting PPDs and 6PPDQ concentrations in human urine among the ML models evaluated. Through the application of these models, age, BMI, and occupation emerged as significant predictors of urinary PPDs and 6PPDQ concentrations. This research significantly contributes by using ML models to enhance exposure assessment accuracy and efficiency, providing a novel framework for future studies on environmental health risks related to PPDs and 6PPDQ.

AB  - The escalating prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has led to a serious global public health problem; therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of structurally innovative antibacterial agents. In our study, different series of tetra-substituted thiophene derivatives were designed and synthesized by multi-component reactions (MCRs) in moderate to excellent yields. Some of the designed final compounds were synthesized by both microwave assisted method and traditional synthesis. Thirteen compounds were evaluated against antibiotic resistance bacteria ESKAPE, among which compounds 11, 13 and 17 showed the most potent inhibitory activities against multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecalis with MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) values as low as 15.62, 7.61 and 15.62 µg/mL, respectively. Two potent candidates 11 and 13 not only showed rapid bactericidal properties and impeded E. faecalis biofilm formation to effectually relieve the development of drug resistance, but also performed low toxicity toward human normal cells. Moreover, time dependent killing assay was performed that showed the reduction of the concentration of bacteria by 5.0 Log (CFU/mL) within 6 h, stronger than reference drug, ampicillin at the same concentration. Additionally, mechanistic investigation demonstrated that both compounds 11 and 13 could exert inhibitory activity against DHPS with IC

AB  - Aminoglycoside-phosphotransferases (APHs) are a class of bacterial enzymes that mediate acquired resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics. Here we report the identification of small molecules counteracting aminoglycoside resistance in Enterococcus casseliflavus. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to identify an allosteric pocket in three APH enzymes belonging to 3' and 2'' subfamilies in which we then screened, in silico, 12,000 small molecules. From a subset of only 14 high-scored molecules tested in vitro, we identified a compound, named here EK3, able to non-competitively inhibit the APH(2'')-IVa, an enzyme mediating clinical gentamicin resistance. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) exploration of this hit compound allowed us to identify a molecule with improved enzymatic inhibition. By measuring bacterial sensitivity, we found that the three best compounds in this series restored bactericidal activity of various aminoglycosides, including gentamicin, without exhibiting toxicity to HeLa cells. This work not only provides a basis to fight aminoglycoside resistance but also highlights a proof-of-concept for the search of allosteric modulators by using in silico methods.

AB  - Two cyclic octadepsipeptides, microascusins A and B (1 and 2), were identified from the marine sponge-associated Microascus croci IMB19-064 co-cultivated with Escherichia coli. Their structures and conformations in solution were determined by comprehensive spectroscopic data analysis. The absolute configurations of amino and hydroxy acids were determined by the advanced Marfey's and O-Marfey's methods, respectively, as well as chiral-phase HPLC analysis. Microascusins A (1) and B (2) represent a new type of cyclic octadepsipeptides characterized by the presence of the unique hydroxy acid l-2-hydroxy-4-cyanobutyric acid. Compound 1 exhibited potent in vitro antiosteoporotic activity with dual regulation effects of promoting the osteoblast-mediated bone formation as well as inhibiting the RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation at the concentrations of 0.1-10 nM. Further in vivo study showed that compound 1 could improve bone mineralization after dexamethasone-induced bone damage in zebrafish through up-regulating the expression of the osteoblast-specific genes Bmp2 and Oc.

AB  - Infectious diseases caused by drug-resistant bacteria represent one of the most significant global public challenges of this century. There is an urgent need for the treatment of drug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections. A series of 3,4-dihydro-2H-[1,3]oxazino[5,6-h]quinoline derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria including strains from ATCC and clinical isolates, initially revealing the structure-activity relationship. Among them, 22 compounds demonstrated inhibitory activity (MICs: 3.125-12.5 μg/mL) against Escherichia coli (E. coli) ATCC 25922 and Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) ATCC 19606. Among these, 7 compounds exhibited good inhibitory activity against MDR A. baumannii clinical isolates, with MICs ranging from 3.125 to 12.5 μg/mL. Most of these compounds also showed lower cytotoxicity than IMB-881. Notably, 2 compounds, 4n1 and 4b3, significantly extended the survival of Galleria mellonella larvae infected with E. coli. Mechanism studies have revealed that compounds 4n1 and 4b3 might disrupt the interaction between LptA and LptC, showing moderate affinity for LptA protein. These compounds also induce abnormal bacterial morphology and cause outer membrane damage. This finding provides a novel class of antibiotic sensitizers with the potential to effectively fight against E. coli and A. baumannii.

AB  - Theanode enables raised microbial fuel cells (MFCs) performance via in-situ growth electroactive material. However, the role of fabricated microstructures in electroactive bacteria loading and extracellular electron transfer (EET) has been paid less attention. Here, MoS2 nanosheets are custom grown on carbon cloth to construct anode models with diverse surface microstructures. Surprisingly, the 3D-MoS2/NS-CC anode only 0.85 d enables the MFC to be started and achieves a maximum power density of 3.85 W/m

AB  - Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are key components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and serve as prognostic markers for breast cancer. Patients with high TIL infiltration generally experience better clinical outcomes and extended survival compared to those with low TIL infiltration. However, as the TME is highly complex and TIL subtypes perform distinct biological functions, TILs may only provide an approximate indication of tumor immune status, potentially leading to biased prognostic results. Therefore, we reviewed the interactions between immune-infiltrating subtypes and tumor cells throughout the entire TME. By examining the antitumor or protumor effects of each TIL subtype, we aimed to better characterize the tumor immune landscape, offering more accurate and comprehensive insights for guiding triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) treatment. In addition, this approach could lead to the development of new therapeutic targets, enabling tailored treatment strategies and precision medicine. Accumulating evidence suggests that the intestinal microbiome and its metabolites influence antitumor responses by modulating innate and adaptive immunity, with specific bacteria potentially serving as biomarkers for predicting clinical responses. Various studies have identified microorganisms in breast tissue, previously considered sterile, revealing differences in breast microbial composition between patients with breast cancer and controls, as well as associations between specific breast microorganisms and clinicopathologic features, including immune correlations. The aim of this review was to provide a more comprehensive set of prognostic markers for TNBC and to tap into potential-specific therapeutic targets.

AB  - Four photosensitizers PS1a-PS4a consisting in multicationic ruthenium(II) phthalocyanines (RuPcs) have been evaluated in photodynamic inactivation (PDI) of multiresistant microorganisms. The RuPcs, bearing from 4 to 12 terminal ammonium salts, have been designed to target the microorganisms cytoplasmic cell membrane and display high singlet oxygen quantum yields. In addition, PS3a and PS4a were conceived to exhibit multi-target localization by endowing them with amphiphilic character, using two different structural approaches. Under low light regimes, the two hydrophilic PS1a and PS2a, as well as the amphiphilic PS3a show much stronger response against Gram-positive MRSA than that observed for the typical phthalocyanines designed for PDI, namely zinc(II) and palladium(II) complexes, as well as free-base Pcs. Besides, PS1a, PS2a and PS3a show remarkably high activity against the Gram-negative E. coli, although weak fungicidal character against fluconazole-resistant C. albicans. Contrasting, the structurally different, amphiphilic PS4a shows only slight activity for Gram-positive bacteria, despite its ability to cross cell membrane and reach internal organelles. Still, PS4a shows a positive synergistic effect against MRSA when combined with doxycycline, exhibiting an increased activity from about 1.5 to about 4.9 log reduction under the light dose of 30 J/cm

AB  - Campylobacter is a major cause of foodborne gastroenteritis worldwide, with the mishandling of contaminated chicken meat among the main pathways for human infection. Granted the disease burden due to this pathogen, systematic assessments of its potential impact are necessary. The aims of this study were to evaluate both presence and load of Campylobacter in chicken meat sold in traditional markets, assess risk factors related with the infrastructure and hygienic conditions of market stalls, and evaluate control strategies for campylobacteriosis in Peru through a quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA), a data-driven, systematic approach to quantitatively assess risks by integrating empirical contamination levels, microbial behavior, and consumer exposure. Between February and December 2022, a total of 90 chicken meat samples from traditional markets were sampled and evaluated by both culture and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Campylobacter spp. were detected in 28 % and 76 % of samples with a mean quantification of 3.3 log

Their structures were inferred by IR, 1D NMR and 2D NMR, and HR-ESI-MS spectra. All the isolated compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activities. Compounds 1-11 had potential antibacterial activities against Bacillus gasoformans, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas solanacearum, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 100 to 3.125 µg/mL. Among them, compound 6 showed the most significant antibacterial activity against four strains of bacteria. These findings elucidated the pharmacological substance basis for the antibacterial activity of T. glabrifolium to some extent.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The quantitative intra-arterial flow dynamics following percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) for severe intracranial artery stenosis have never been investigated. We aimed to evaluate peritherapeutic intracranial artery flow dynamics following PTAS with quantitative magnetic resonance angiography (qMRA) to predict long-term stent patency. DESIGN: This is a prospective, single-center study. METHODS: We recruited participants with severe symptomatic stenosis from intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) to M1 segment of middle cerebral artery (MCA) between 2018 and 2022. qMRA was performed before (preprocedural), within 24 h after (early postprocedural) and 12 months after (delayed postprocedural) PTAS, and parameters including bilateral M1 segments and basilar artery (BA) flow were recorded. The calibrated M1 ratio was calculated using contralateral M1 (cM1) and BA (cMB) flows as references. We assessed differences in qMRA parameters between subjects with and without significant 12-month in-stent restenosis (ISR). RESULTS: Forty-four subjects (12 with + 32 without ISR ≥ 50 %) were included. The early postprocedural M1 flow was higher than preprocedural M1 flow in subjects with (p = 0.030) and without (p = 0.031) ISR. The early postprocedural healthy-side M1 flow was lower than preprocedural healthy-side M1 flow (p = 0.014) in subjects without ISR. Both the early (p < 0.001) and delayed (p = 0.014) cM1s were greater than the preprocedural cM1. The residual stenosis grade was positively correlated with delayed postprocedural cM1 in all subjects (r CONCLUSIONS: The cM1 and a distinct flow dynamic pattern on early qMRA (within 24 h after PTAS) may predict 12-month ISR.

AB  - Tuberculosis is a highly infectious disease and it is a global threat in particular affecting people from developing countries. It is thought that nearly one-third of the global population lives with this causative bacterium in its dominant form. The spread of HIV and the development of resistance to both multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) aggravates the spread of the disease and needs novel drugs which combat this disease effectively. Triazole-containing anti-tubercular drugs are promising and need further tuning to develop as a potent scaffold for tuberculosis. In this review, we highlight the structural activity relationships of triazole-containing drugs and detailed understanding for the researchers in the field of medicinal chemistry to further explore these triazole-based compounds as well as synthesize new compounds for antitubercular activity against drug-sensitive and resistant strains.

AB  - Here, we report a synthesis of fluoroquinolones carrying a monoterpene moiety at the C7 position of aromatic structure. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of fluoroquinolone fused with trans-3-hydroxy-cis-myrtanylamine 18 against Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA isolates) were two- to eightfold lower compared to moxifloxacin, although fourfold higher against MRSA isolates. The fluoroquinolone fused with (-)-nopylamine 16 was four- to eightfold less active on MSSA compared to moxifloxacin, while had similar activity on MRSA. Against biofilms, both 16 and 18 were four times more active than both moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Both 16 and 18 induced the drop of membrane potential and in silico exhibited similar binding energies with DNA gyrase of S. aureus (ΔG -13.44 to -13.17 kcal/mol), suggesting dual mechanism of action (topoisomerase inhibition by the fluoroquinolone core and membrane damage by the monoterpene fragment). Thus, our data demonstrate the perspectives of monoterpenes fusion to an antibiotic moiety to obtain dual-acting bipharmacophore antimicrobials with improved activity, including biofilm-associated infections.

AB  - Investigations into fruit and vegetable processing residues (FVPRs) offer huge opportunities to discover novel therapeutics against many diseases. In this study, detailed investigation of Garcinia mangostana fruit peel extract led to the isolation and identification of ten known compounds (1-10). Further, a new series of α-mangostin derived sulphonyl piperzines, aryl alkynes and 1,2,3-triazole derivatives were synthesized using Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cyclo-addition reaction ("click" chemistry). Both isolated compounds and synthetic derivatives were evaluated for their anti-chikungunya activity (CHIKV). Isolated compounds, gartanin (1), mangostenone-F (4), 1-isomangostin (5), mangostenone-D (6), epicatechin (7) and derivatives 14, 15c, 15d, 15e, 15f, 17d, 17f, and 18h exerted anti-CHIKV activity. Compounds 17d, 17f and 18h manifested higher antiviral activity (>2 log reduction in virus titer) with a selectivity index (SI) > 50. The compounds with higher antiviral activity were evaluated further with various assays, time of addition assay, entry and entry bypass assay and were also subjected to molecular docking with viral proteins. The results revealed that 17d, 17f and 18h affect multiple stages of virus life cycle through probable interaction with envelope proteins and nsP3 macrodomain of CHIKV. Overall, this study provides evidence for anti-CHIKV activity of natural xanthones from Garcinia mangostana L and their derivatives which could be further investigated for development of therapeutics against chikungunya.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance stands as the foremost post-pandemic threat to public health. The urgent need for new, effective antibacterial treatments is evident. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs), owing to their pivotal role in microbial physiology, emerge as novel and attractive targets. Particularly promising is the α-subunit/β-sliding clamp interaction, crucial for the replicative competence of bacterial DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. Through pharmacophore-based virtual screening, we identified 4,000 candidate small molecule inhibitors targeting the β-clamp binding pocket. Subsequently, these candidates underwent evaluation using the BRET assay in yeast cells. Following this, three hits and 28 analogues were validated via Protein Thermal Shift and competitive ELISA assays. Among them, thiazolo[4,5-

AB  - In public health, risk experts often define acceptable risk targets without community input. We developed a novel method for applying behavioral microeconomics to integrate individuals' risk preferences into risk assessment. To demonstrate this methodology, we explored a risk-risk tradeoff case scenario: increased asthma risk from increased cleaning and disinfection (C&D) and increased infection risk from decreased C&D for healthcare staff. Utilizing a risk-risk tradeoff (RRTO) framework, two datasets were informed with RRTO survey data describing the risks individuals would accept for one outcome to offset risk in another (i.e., "risk target"). A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) was deployed to output "critical concentrations," viral concentrations on surfaces that yield risk targets for a single contaminated surface touch and a work shift. Critical concentrations were over four orders of magnitude larger for single-touch scenarios. Critical concentrations across risk target datasets were similar. Using the RRTO framework to inform QMRA advances the incorporation of individuals' risk preferences in risk analyses outside economics.

AB  - Research on natural antioxidants derived from plants has surged due to their potential health benefits. In the current study, the chemical composition, enzyme inhibitory activity, and antimicrobial effects of the Elaeagnus angustifolia L. plant, including leaves, flowers, and flower stalk (FS) extracts, were analyzed. A total of 28 compounds were identified across the different plant parts, with 24 in flowers (F), 9 in FSs, and 14 in leaves (L). The antimicrobial activity of the extracts was evaluated using the disk diffusion method against two Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) and two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined as 3.13-12.50 mg/mL. The measured zone diameters were also in the range of 5-8 mm. The results indicated that the methanol extracts exhibited significant antimicrobial properties. Additionally, the extracts demonstrated strong inhibition of cholinesterases (acetylcholinesterase [AChE]: 11.14 ± 0.11-18.11 ± 0.12 µg/mL; butyrylcholinesterase [BChE]: 32.54 ± 0.55-44.61 ± 0.17 µg/mL) and moderate inhibition against α-glycosidase and tyrosinase enzymes. Moreover, the molecular docking interaction of trans-ferulic, shikimic, and vanillic acids, the most abundant phenolic compounds in the extracts, with AChE, BChE, α-glycosidase, and tyrosinase, was assessed using AutoDock Vina software. E. angustifolia L. possesses a high phenolic content and exhibits significant antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory capabilities, which may contribute to its extensive utilization in food and traditional medicine.

AB  - Given the ever-evolving landscape of antimicrobial resistance, the emergence of New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) has introduced a formidable challenge to global public health. In previous research, we identified the Compound Zndm19 as an NDM-1 inhibitor and reported Zndm19 derivatives, which exhibited moderate antibacterial activity when combined with meropenem (MEM). This moderate activity may have been due to the inability of Zndm19 to efficiently penetrate the bacterial outer membrane or its susceptibility to hydrolysis, which prevented it from exerting strong enzyme inhibition in synergy with bacterial cells. In this study, we aimed to overcome these limitations by employing a scaffold hopping strategy, abandoning the original core structure. We designed and synthesized 21 compounds and discovered that Compound A8 could effectively restore the antibacterial activity of MEM against NDM-1-positive Escherichia coli (E. coli). Compound A8 restored the ability of MEM to penetrate the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria, leading to oxidative stress-induced disarray within bacterial cells. This disruption ultimately led to the impairment of bacterial cell membrane integrity and permeability, consequently amplifying the synergistic antimicrobial efficacy of the combined treatment. Furthermore, compared with Zndm19, Compound A8 demonstrated broader therapeutic applications in the Galleria mellonella infection model and the murine peritonitis infection model. Molecular docking, site-directed mutagenesis, and fluorescence quenching assays confirmed that Compound A8 could directly interact with NDM-1, thereby further inhibiting its hydrolytic activity. These findings elucidate the antimicrobial mechanism of novel methyl dithiocarbamate derivatives and provide new insights for the development of new NDM-1 inhibitors.

AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes nosocomial infections and chronic diseases. Cinnamomum cassia and Syzygium aromaticum are used natural antimicrobials. Essential oil (EO) from C. cassia (CCEO) and S. aromaticum (CEO) was characterized using GC-MS analysis. Eugenol (82.31%), eugenol acetate (10.57%), and β-caryophyllene (3.41%) were major constituents in CEO while cinnamaldehyde (88.18%), cinnamyl acetate (2.85%) and 2-methoxy cinnamaldehyde (1.77%) were main components in CCEO. The EOs and major constituents exhibited good antimicrobial activity against clinical strains of P. aeruginosa. Cinnamaldehyde exhibited the best antimicrobial effect with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) as low as 0.031% ± 0.07% (v/v) and inhibition zones reaching 30 ± 0.5 mm diameter. Test samples showed antibiofilm activities against two culture types and seven clinical strains of P. aeruginosa at concentrations of 2MIC to MIC/4. CCEO and its major constituent cinnamaldehyde were more active, compared to CEO and its major constituent eugenol. Scanning electron microscopy images showed untreated colonies with well-developed biofilms while there was significant reduction of biofilms with distorted architecture and cell shrinkage upon treatment with test samples. In silico studies indicated great interactions between the major compounds, eugenol and cinnamaldehyde, with the receptor proteins of P. aeruginosa revealed by negative binding energies. Eugenol and cinnamaldehyde exhibited appreciable druglikeness.

AB  - Our understanding of the physiological mechanisms of the plant hormetic response to countless environmental contaminants is rapidly advancing. However, the microbiome is a critical determinant of plant responses to stressors, thus possibly influencing hormetic responses. Here, we review the otherwise neglected role of microbes in shaping plant stimulation by subtoxic concentrations of contaminants and vice versa. Numerous contaminants at subtoxic levels enhance microorganisms and proliferate symbionts, such as mycorrhizae and other plant beneficial microbes, leading to both direct and indirect improvements in plant physiological performance. Microbial symbiosis facilitates nutrient uptake by plants, indicating an important contribution of symbionts to phytostimulation under subtoxic contamination. We also discuss the mechanisms and implications of the stimulation of plant-microbe systems by subtoxic contaminants.

AB  - Bacillus cereus sphingomyelinase C (B. cereus SMase), which plays a crucial role in bacterial virulence, has emerged as a new therapeutic target for treating opportunistic infections caused by this pathogen. It also shares catalytic domain similarity with human neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2), which is implicated in Alzheimer's disease. In this study, a series of quinazoline derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their inhibition of B. cereus SMase, electric eel acetylcholinesterase (EeAChE), and equine butyrylcholinesterase (eqBuChE). Moreover, the antibacterial, anti-hemolytic and metal chelation properties of the selected compounds were determined.

AB  - The objective of this study was to preliminarily explore the effects of Calsporin® (Bacillus subtilis C-3102) on the growth performance, intestinal morphology, apparent digestibility, and cecal microbiota of geese. A total of 144 Sanhua geese, aged 35 days, were randomly divided into three groups: a control group, a group receiving a basal diet supplemented with 30 ppm Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis), and a group receiving a basal diet supplemented with 60 ppm B. subtilis. Each group had six replicates, with eight geese per replicate. The study consisted of a one-week pre-feeding period followed by a four-week experimental period. The results indicated that, compared to the control group, the group supplemented with 60 ppm B. subtilis showed a significant increase in final body weight and the average daily gain (P < 0.05). Both the 30 ppm and 60 ppm B. subtilis groups exhibited significant improvements in the feed/gain (F/G) ratio (P < 0.05). Additionally, supplementation with either 30 ppm or 60 ppm B. subtilis significantly increased the height of the ileum villi (P < 0.05), with a trend towards an increased villus height to crypt depth (VH/CD) ratio (P > 0.05). In terms of digestive enzyme activity, both 30 ppm and 60 ppm B. subtilis supplementation significantly enhanced the activities of ileum cellulase and chymotrypsin (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the apparent digestibility of crude ash, crude protein, and Ca was significantly improved in the 60 ppm B. subtilis group (P < 0.05). Microbial analysis revealed that B. subtilis increased the abundance of potential probiotics bacterial families, such as Turicibacter, and butyrate-producing, including Prevotellaceae Ga6Al. In conclusion, supplementation with 60 ppm B. subtilis can significantly enhance the growth performance, intestinal morphology, and apparent digestibility of geese. Increasing the supplementation level may further optimize these benefits.

AB  - PURPOSE: The primary objective was to evaluate the clinical response of refractory cases of fungal keratitis to topical 1% posaconazole therapy. METHODS: Prospective longitudinal non-randomized open label dual-cohort study of 70 eyes of refractory fungal keratitis, 35 were recruited as posaconazole treatment (PCZ) group for topical 1% posaconazole therapy and compared to 35 eyes on conventional antifungal therapy. Study parameters included demographic and treatment details, visual acuity, comprehensive slit-lamp biomicroscopy, clinical photography, ASOCT at recruitment and weekly (week 1, 2, 3 and 4 after treatment initiation). Clinical assessment included keratitis severity grade, time of healing, and healing response. Anti-fungal susceptibility testing was performed. RESULTS: The mean age of 35 patients recruited in the PCZ treatment group was 45 ± 17.32 years and that for the conventional treatment group was 43.22 ± 15.04 years. Culture isolation was possible in 25 eyes (71.4%) in the PCZ treatment group, with Fusarium and Aspergillus spp. being the most common cornea pathogenic mycotic organisms. The mean healing time in the PCZ group was 27.13 ± 5.8 days and in the conventional treatment group was 26.41 ± 4.81 days. Healing response in the PCZ treatment showed that 27 eyes (77.14%) had healed, 3 (8.5%) had delayed healing, and 5 (14.28%) required therapeutic keratoplasty, whereas in the conventional treatment group, 26 (74.28%) healed, 2 (5.7%) had delayed healing, and 7 (20%) needed keratoplasty (P = 0.65, 0.72, 0.54, respectively). Topical 1% PCZ therapy of chronic mycotic keratitis was helpful in resolution in 85.7% of cases (30 eyes) with five eyes needing surgical intervention, which was comparable to that of conventional antimycotic therapy cohorts. Fusarium isolates showed greater susceptibility to natamycin in our study per MIC50 values, with susceptibility to the common antimycotic agents varying between the Aspergillus spp. in both PCZ treatment and conventional treatment groups. All isolates showed minimal values of MIC-50 with PCZ. Antifungal susceptibility testing in our study recruits showed that about 90% of the Fusarium spp. isolates to be best responsive to natamycin and PCZ, whereas Aspergillus niger isolates were sensitive to voriconazole, itraconazole, amphotericin B, and PCZ, Aspergillus flavus to voriconazole and PCZ, Aspergillus fumigatus to both polyenes and triazoles. Cladosporium spp. were best sensitive to natamycin and PCZ, Penicillium spp. to natamycin and azoles. Alternaria keratitis isolates were sensitive to voriconazole and PCZ, whereas Rhizopus isolate was best sensitive to PCZ. CONCLUSION: Topical 1% PCZ therapy in refractory fungal keratitis was comparable to that of conventional antimycotic agents, with lower MIC-50 against the common pathogenic fungi as compared to natamycin, amphotericin B, and voriconazole.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation of a novel soluble yeast cell wall (YCW) on growth performance, gut health, intestinal morphology, and immune response in broiler chickens for 42 days. A total of 480 one-day-old Cobb 500 male broilers were randomly assigned to four treatments with six replicates and each replicate of twenty broiler chickens: a control group (CON) without feed additive supplementation, and three groups supplemented with YCW at 0.025 % (YCW1), 0.050 % (YCW2), and 0.100 % (YCW3). Results showed that 0.025 % and 0.100 % YCW supplementation significantly increased (P < 0.05) final body weight (BW) and overall body weight gain (BWG) while reducing overall feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared to the CON group. The YCW supplementation also improved (P < 0.05) the balance of gut microbiota by increasing beneficial bacteria (Lactobacillus) and decreasing Salmonella, a potential foodborne pathogen in humans in the ceca. Although intestinal morphology was not significantly affected, YCW supplementation numerically increased the villus height: crypt depth ratio (VH:CD) compared to the CON group. Furthermore, YCW reduced the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and INF-γ) and tight junction protein claudin-1 (CLDN-1) (P < 0.05), suggesting balanced immune response and improved intestinal barrier function. In conclusion, the supplementation of soluble YCW in broiler diets positively influenced growth performance, gut microbiota composition, and immune response, demonstrating its potential as a viable alternative to antibiotics for improving broilers' health.

AB  - By introducing ester warheads into the hydroxyl groups in lycorine (1), three types of lycorine mono-ester or di-ester analogues were synthesized and evaluated for their antiviral activities against HCoV-OC43. Most of them showed higher selective indexes (SI) than 1, up to nearly 14 times. Using compound 6b as a probe, we firstly demonstrated that lycorine esters directly targeted nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) domain in the non-structural protein 12 (nsp 12) by reversibly acylating Cys12 to induce the shrink of NiRAN pocket and block the viral replication, different from the known RdRp inhibitors. Meanwhile, the reversible acylation mode of lycorine esters guaranteed the higher SI values and long-acting effects of its kind. Thus, in addition to acting as prodrugs, ester compounds with a highly acylating warhead can be used as covalent probes to explore the detailed mode of action and improve the safety window. Compound 6b has been identified as a new reversible covalent RdRp allosteric inhibitor for further investigation.

AB  - The emergence of multiple drug-resistant bacteria poses critical health threats worldwide. It is urgently needed to develop potent and safe antibacterial agents with novel bactericidal mechanisms to treat these infections. In this study, magnolol was identified as a potential bacterial cell division inhibitor by a cell-based screening approach. This compound showed good antibacterial activity against a number of Gram-positive pathogens (minimum inhibitory concentration 8-16 µg/mL) including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. Further results obtained from biochemical experiments demonstrated that magnolol could markedly disrupt GTPase activity and filamentous temperature-sensitive mutant Z (FtsZ) polymerization, consistent with the impediment to cell division in the bacteria tested. The in vivo antibacterial activity of magnolol was evaluated with a Galleria mellonella larvae model. The results showed that magnolol significantly increased the survival rate of larvae infected with methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The interaction pattern of magnolol with FtsZ was investigated through molecular docking. The finding may offer meaningful insights into the mechanism of action of the compound. The results point to magnolol as a promising antimicrobial compound that inhibits cell division by affecting FtsZ polymerization and has the potential to be developed into an effective antimicrobial drug by further structure modification.

AB  - Quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) of pathogens in food safety is well established, but steps are being taken to expand this methodology to food spoilage. Parallels can be drawn between the steps involved in a QMRA for pathogens and its application to specific spoilage organisms (SSO). During hazard characterisation for pathogens, the appropriate dose-response model is used to link the hazard level to the health outcome by estimating the probability of illness, resulting from the ingestion of a certain dose of the hazard. The dose-response model, in the case of food spoilage, may be translated into a spoilage-response relationship linking the spoilage-level with the probability the consumer will discard the food and not consume it. Such models are developed with sensory testing, assessing consumers sensitivity to microbial spoilage quality defects and correlating them to the SSO concentration. Ignoring food spoilage before the stated expiration date can lead to the final health risk being overestimated, since cases in which the food item poses a real risk to the consumer but is not consumed due to perceived spoilage are not excluded. Plenty of risk assessments have been carried out for pathogens in different RTE foods. What is missing is the integration of the two approaches into a single model that can estimate the risk of illness, factoring in the variability of consumer responses to spoilage. The spoilage-response relationship was combined with a stochastic modelling approach for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and

AB  - The fellowship, entitled 'Training in modern statistical methodologies and software tools for the definition and analysis of (stochastic) quantitative microbial risk assessment models with relevant food products for the Italian and Spanish food supply chains', was implemented at the Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena (UPCT), Spain. Supervised by Dr. Alberto Garre and Prof. Pablo S. Fernandez and coordinated by Dr. Virginia Filipello of the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Italy, the fellowship aimed to provide hands-on training in quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA). The fellow benefited from UPCT's expertise in microbiological risk assessment, gaining knowledge of methodologies, terminologies and software tools essential for QMRA. The focus of the fellowship was on the risks associated with plant-based milk products, which are increasingly popular as sustainable alternatives to dairy milk. Despite the heat treatments these beverages undergo to ensure safety, risks persist, such as cross-contamination during post-processing or the survival of heat-resistant spores like Bacillus cereus. A recent European outbreak linked to contaminated oat milk underscored the importance of assessing these risks. The project was conducted in two phases: first, at UPCT's Food Microbiology Laboratory, where the fellow handled and characterised the thermal resistance of various B. cereus strains using a thermoresistometer; and second, through remote analysis of experimental data using risk analysis software tools. The fellow developed skills in microbiological techniques, such as spore preparation and thermal resistance evaluation, and became proficient in data analysis using the R programming language and the biorisk package. The fellowship culminated in the development of a QMRA model to estimate the likelihood of B. cereus-related foodborne illness from plant-based milks, considering different heat treatments and bacterial strains. The fellow's training covered all stages of risk assessment, including hazard identification, exposure assessment, hazard characterisation and risk characterisation, providing a comprehensive foundation for a career in food safety and microbial risk assessment.

AB  - In the context of the European Food Risk Assessment (EU-FORA) fellowship programme, the project 'Q4MRATools: Quantitative Tools to Microbial Risk Assessment' focused on training in predictive microbiology, experimental design and the use of advanced software tools like R, MATLAB, @Risk, DMFit and GInaFiT. The primary objective of this programme was to equip the fellow with foundational knowledge in quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRA), thereby contributing to the development of more effective and accurate food safety risk assessments. This initiative was part of a broader effort to address the evolving challenges in food safety by enhancing collaborative actions and developing robust food safety systems. The fellow engaged in various risk assessment tasks, acquiring fundamental knowledge in predictive microbiology, particularly different modelling strategies for growth and inactivation models, as well as understanding the nuances of microbiological behaviour under different conditions and food matrixes environments. The training emphasised the importance of experimental design and the application of software tools essential for conducting QMRA. Secondary activities were also included to broaden the fellow's competencies, expanding their expertise beyond qualitative methods.

AB  - The current comprehensive study showcases a meticulous synthesis of novel class of α-benzilmonoxime thiocarbohydrazide (BMOTC) derivatives, and manifesting their multifaceted potential as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer agents. The synthesis of target compounds was performed in three phases using literature methods. In the first step, benzilmonoxime is synthesized using benzil and hydroxyl amine hydrochloride, followed by benzilmonoxime imine using thiocarbohydrazide. The final stage involves combining BMOTC imine with various aldehydes and ketones. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the synthesized derivatives against five bacterial panels, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative, and one fungal pathogen have been screened. Twelve of the twenty-four synthetic derivatives showed noteworthy activity; eight derivatives exhibited growth inhibition (GI) >73 % against Acinetobacter baumannii, two exhibited GI >95 % against Escherichia coli, and two exhibited GI >93 % against Candida albicans at concentration 32 μg/mL. Further assessment revealed that two derivatives 5v and 5w, exhibited negligible cytotoxicity towards human embryonic kidney cells (HK-293) and human red blood cells (RBC), signifying their promising safety profile at concentration 32 μg/mL (GI against Candida albicans - 97.51 % and 93.71 % respectively). The synthesized compounds were subjected to in vitro cytostatic activity, where a rigorous scrutiny against a diverse panel of NCI 60 cancer cell lines representing various malignancies was carried out. A total of eleven compounds emerged as promising candidates, demonstrating significant growth percent (GP) at a concentration of 10 µM. Notably, compounds 5d, 5h, and 5x, turned up as standout performers, exhibiting potent anticancer activity across multiple cancer types, including colon, CNS, melanoma, and breast cancers. Of particular interest, compound 5d displayed notable antiproliferative effects against leukemia cancer cell lines RPMI-8226 & SR, while maintaining non-cytotoxicity against the same. Compound 5h showcased activity against ovarian, non-small cell lung, and prostate cancers, without inducing cytotoxic effects. Compound 5x demonstrated remarkable anticancer activity against leukemia and breast cancer cell lines, further bolstered by its non-cytotoxic nature. A compelling aspect of this study is the comparative analysis with the established drug molecule sunitinib, revealing that compounds 5d, 5h, and 5x exhibit superior potency. These findings not only highlight the therapeutic potential of the BMOTC derivatives but also underscore their viability as promising candidates for future drug development endeavours. This study serves as a pivotal step towards harnessing the untapped therapeutic potential of BMOTC derivatives in combating microbial infections and advancing cancer therapy.

AB  - A novel series of steroidal β-carboline quaternary ammonium derivatives (SCQADs) derived from natural cholic acid and its derivatives was designed, synthesized and biologically evaluated against four Gram-positive bacteria for the first time. Most of these derivatives exhibited promising antibacterial activity against the tested strains, particularly, compound 21g displayed strong antibacterial activity against MRSA (MIC = 0.5-1 μg/mL) with low cytotoxicity. Meanwhile, derivative 21g was able to quickly kill Gram-positive bacteria within 0.5 h without inducing bacterial resistance. Preliminary mechanistic explorations indicated that compound 21g destroyed bacterial cell membranes to exert its antibacterial effects. Moreover, 21g exhibited high in vivo efficacy and high survival protection in a mouse skin abscess model. These findings suggested that compound 21g has great potential to develop as an antibacterial agent.

AB  - Targeting the biosynthetic pathway of mycolic acid is highly attractive to researchers in the field of novel anti-tubercular drug development. Pks13-TE is an essential catalytic component in the last assembling step of mycolic acid, and the co-crystal structures of the Pks13-TE-inhibitor complex provide insight into ligand recognition. Based on a structure-guided strategy, N-aryl indole derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their antitubercular activities. Compound 44 was identified as the most promising compound with high potency against M. tb H37Rv (MIC = 0.07 μM) and a favorable metabolic profile in human liver microsomes. Moreover, compound 44 exhibited oral bioavailability in a serum inhibition titration (SIT) assay, which warrants further development.

AB  - Acetohydroxy acid synthase (AHAS) is a key enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of branched-chain amino acids, which is indispensable for the survival and growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Aim to discover new AHAS inhibitors from natural products, here we performed computer assistant target-based screening for Mtb-AHAS inhibitors using Discovery Studio on TCMSP and SELLECK libraries. Mtb-AHAS structure was first simulated and verified for docking, and 80 compounds with top LIBDOCK and CDDOCK scores were obtained. By experimental verification, four compounds namely Salvianolic acid A, Embelin, Celastrol and Wushanicaritin showed inhibition potency against Mtb-AHAS with IC50 ranging from 805.5 nM-32.36 μM. The most potential inhibitor Celastrol exhibited bacteriostatic activity for both Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis with MIC of 62.5 μM and 80 μM, respectively. This study revealed that Celastrol is the potential Mtb-AHAS inhibitor as an anti-tuberculosis lead compound.

AB  - Single treatment methods for wound infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria often fail to simultaneously achieve high antimicrobial efficacy and wound healing efficiency. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a small molecule prodrug that can achieve both goals, in this context, we have engineered a green-light-activated nitric oxide photocage/photodynamic therapeutic prodrug, designed to release NO, which not only potentiates antimicrobial efficacy but also facilitates collagen accumulation at the wound interface, thereby expediting the wound healing process. Additionally, it mitigates tissue inflammation by suppressing the NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, the introduction of the photosensitiser rhodamine can be used for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). aPDT exhibits enhanced antimicrobial efficacy by specifically targeting and disrupting bacterial cell membranes. Notably, this treatment significantly reduced bacterial viability in vitro and accelerated healing of MRSA-induced wound infections even at low concentrations. The developed NO photocage/photodynamic prodrug RhB-NO-1 is biocompatible and has demonstrated the ability to significantly accelerate the healing process of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU), making it a promising next-generation pharmacological treatment for chronic wound management.

AB  - The need for sustainable and safe alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters has driven researchers to explore organic acids (OAs) inclusion in broiler diets. Citric acid (CA), a notable OA, has emerged as a promising alternative due to its various physiological benefits, including improved nutrient digestibility, antioxidant properties, and enhanced weight gain. Despite the improved growth performance, the feed conversion ratio (FCR) does not seem to be consistently affected by CA inclusion. A considerable number of research papers suggest that CA can replace antibiotic growth promoters and has proved to be more effective when combined with other additives like probiotics and microbial phytase. However, despite numerous trials, the near-accurate dose remains in doubt. Dietary addition between 1.65 % and 2.65 % seems to positively affect broiler performance. Being an organic acid, CA brings no risk to the environment and does not economically burden producers. It has the capability to enhance certain meat qualities and extend shelf life. However, there is a risk of acidic stress and liver damage with excessive inclusion. This review study seeks to offer a thorough and all-encompassing summary of the present level of understanding regarding the use of CA supplementation in broiler diets by describing its impacts on growth efficiency, nutrient utilization, intestinal condition, immune response, meat quality, optimal dose, and environmental sustainability. Further research focused on determining precise dosage levels and understanding the synergistic or antagonistic effects of citric acid when combined with other feed additives is essential for optimizing broiler performance.

AB  - Iron is essential for the formation, maturation and dispersal of bacterial biofilms, playing a crucial role in the physiological and metabolic functions of bacteria as well as in the regulation of virulence. Limited availability of iron can impair the formation of robust biofilms by altering cellular motility, hydrophobicity and protein composition of the bacterial surface. In this study, the antibiofilm activity of two natural iron chelating agents, kojic acid (5-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl-4H-pyran-4-one) and maltol (3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4-pyrone), were investigated against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, the ability of these 2-hydroxy-4-pyrone derivatives in preventing and eradicating S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilms through the enhancement of the efficacy of two antibiotics (tobramycin and ciprofloxacin) was explored. The iron binding capacity of the kojic acid and maltol was confirmed by their affinity for iron (III) which was found to be about 90 %, comparable to the regular chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, 89 %). The antibiofilm efficacy of 2-hydroxy-4-pyrone derivatives, alone and in combination with antibiotics, was evaluated by measuring the total biomass, metabolic activity, and culturability of biofilm cells. Furthermore, their impact on the membrane integrity of S. aureus biofilm cells was investigated using flow cytometry and epifluorescence microscopy with propidium iodide staining. It was also examined the ability of 2-hydroxy-4-pyrone derivatives and 2-hydroxy-4-pyrone derivate-antibiotic dual-combinations in inhibiting the production of virulence factors (total proteases, lipases, gelatinases and siderophores) by S. aureus. Regarding biofilm formation, the results showed that 2-hydroxy-4-pyrone derivatives alone reduced the metabolic activity of S. aureus biofilm cells by over 40 %.

AB  - Analysis of an antimicrobial extract from the agar-based culture of the marine-derived actinomycete Streptomyces sp. G666 led to the isolation of three new shikimic acid derivatives, streptomine A-C (1-3), along with five known compounds (4-8). Their structures were established by their spectral data analyses, including MS and NMR. All the isolated compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against a panel of clinically significant microorganisms. Three new compounds 1-3 demonstrated selective antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis with MIC values ranging from 32 to 64 µg/mL. Compound 3 exhibited the highest inhibitory effect against E. faecalis with an MIC value of 32 µg/mL. Compound 4 selectively inhibited Escherichia coli with an MIC value of 128 µg/mL. In addition, compounds 1-3 moderately inhibited the yeast Candida albicans with the same MIC value of 16 µg/mL. Unfortunately, most of isolated compounds were inactive against Gram-negative bacteria E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Identifying and assessing hemodynamic and flow status in patients with symptomatic ICA occlusion is crucial for evaluating recurrent stroke risk. The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation between 2 quantitative imaging modalities: 1) blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and 2) quantitative MR angiography (qMRA) with noninvasive optimal vessel analysis (NOVA), measuring volume flow rate (VFR). Comparing these modalities is relevant for assessing collateral circulation and hemodynamic impairment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data, 37 symptomatic patients with unilateral ICA occlusion, who underwent both NOVA-qMRA and BOLD-CVR investigation, were included. The correlation analysis between NOVA-qMRA-derived second segment of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA-P2) VFR and BOLD-CVR (hemispheric and MCA territory CVR) was done by using a linear mixed-effects model. RESULTS: A moderate correlation was found between P2-VFR and BOLD-CVR values for the ipsilateral MCA territory ( CONCLUSIONS: This correlation suggests that impaired BOLD-CVR is partly linked to an increased PCA-P2 volume flow rate, potentially indicating the activation of leptomeningeal collaterals in severe hemodynamic conditions. Both imaging techniques could aid clinicians in creating personalized treatment strategies for patients with symptomatic ICA occlusion.

AB  - This experiment aimed to investigate the effects of dietary metabolizable energy (ME) and crude protein (CP) levels and their interaction on the performance, meat quality, and cecal microbiota of Taihe Silky Fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus Brisson) during the growing period. A total of 2160 55-day-old Taihe Silky Fowl (half male and half female) were randomly divided into 9 groups with 6 replicates per group and 40 chickens per replicate. The fowl were fed with a 3 × 3 factor diet (ME: 11.7 MJ/kg, 12.1 MJ/kg, 12.6 MJ/kg; CP: 17.0%, 18.0%, 19.0%). The results showed as follows: with the increase of dietary ME level, the average daily feed intake (ADFI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of Taihe Silky Fowl during the growing period were significantly decreased (P < 0.05), reaching the lowest value in 12.6 MJ/kg group, which were decreased by 5.86% and 8.41% compared with 11.7 MJ/kg group, respectively. The dressing percentage and half-eviscerated yield rate were significantly increased (P < 0.01), with no significant difference between 12.1 and 12.6 MJ/kg groups. Dietary CP level and the interaction between ME and CP had no significant effects on growth performance, slaughter performance, organ index, serum biochemical indexes and meat quality of Taihe Silky Fowl during growing period. The richness and diversity of cecal microbiota decreased gradually with the increase of dietary ME level, and the community structure changed significantly (P < 0.05). High ME diet (12.6 MJ/kg) significantly increased the abundance of Bacteroides (P < 0.05), especially the genus Alistipes, which may indirectly improve nutrient absorption efficiency and overall health status of Taihe Silky Fowl through its metabolites and effects on intestinal microbial community structure, thereby reducing FCR. In conclusion, the optimal production performance and economic benefits can be obtained when the diet ME is 12.6 MJ/kg and CP is 17.0%.

AB  - The Pseudomonas aeruginosa LasR quorum sensing system (QSS) is central to regulating the expression of several pathogenicity factors. Also, while seed- and/or plant-derived products have been investigated as QSS regulators, the impact of Helianthus annuus (Pannar sunflower seed cultivars) extracts and metabolites as LasR modulators remain underexplored. Thus, this study focused on the untargeted metabolomic profiling (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry), in vitro and in silico (docking, pharmacokinetics, dynamic simulation) bioprospection of Pannar seed cultivars' extracts and metabolites as LasR modulators. The extracts showed significant QS modulating properties (motility, violacein, biofilm, cell attachment, pyocyanin inhibition) with the PAN 7102 CLP seed cultivar (74.3 %) being the most potent, compared to azithromycin (65 %) and cinnamaldehyde (62 %). Chemometric principal component analysis (PCA) analysis showed distinct metabolite signatures with 52.5 % variance across the six cultivars that was driven by aqueous and ethanolic extracts of PAN 7102, 7160, and 7156 cultivars. The presence of methoxymellein, hydroxytetradecanedioic acid, koninginin G, geoside, pinellic acid and methylpicraquassioside A were reported for the first time.

AB  - This study investigates the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of fractions from the stem extract of Bauhinia pulchella Benth. The ethanolic extract was fractionated using column adsorption chromatography, resulting in a hexane fraction (J1) and a dichloromethane fraction (J2), both rich in terpenes and steroids. Characterization was performed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Antimicrobial activity was assessed through minimal lethal concentrations (MLC) and minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), and the checkerboard method was employed to evaluate the synergistic effect. For anti-inflammatory activity, an in vitro model using murine macrophage cell culture (RAW 264.7) was employed to measure the levels of nitric oxide (NO), TGF-β, and TNF-α. The results demonstrated antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa ATCC 10226, S. cholerasuis ATCC 14028, the genus Candida, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, and S. aureus ATCC 25923. Synergism was observed between the fractions and cephalexin, norfloxacin, gentamicin, and polymyxin. The use of fractions J1 (125, 62.5, and 31.25 µg/mL) and J2 (62.5 µg/mL) resulted in a significant reduction in TNF-α levels. For NO and TGF-β, both J1 (125, 62.5, and 31.25 µg/mL) and J2 (62.5, 31.25, and 15.625 µg/mL) fractions showed significant reductions in these inflammatory markers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sansevieria trifasciata, common name, mother-in-law's tongue, is a member of the Agavaceae family. We undertook this study to evaluate the cytotoxicity of S. trifasciata leaf extract against two cancer cell lines as well as its antibacterial activities against six bacterial strains. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The investigated cell lines include primary colon epithelial (PCE) cells and human colorectal cancer cells; the studied bacterial strains are Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Using the agar well-diffusion method, various doses (5, 10, and 20 mg/mL) of plant extracts (ethanol and petroleum ether) were evaluated against each kind of bacterial strain. The minimal inhibitory doses were found using the two-fold serial dilution approach, with a range of 0.156-5 mg/mL. RESULTS: Comparing extracts of S. trifasciata leaves to tetracycline (0.05 mg/mL), a common antibiotic, revealed a wide range of antibacterial activity. P. vulgaris and S. aureus were the most sensitive bacterial strains to ethanol and petroleum ether extracts, respectively. The MTT test was employed to ascertain the viable cell count of PCE cells and HCT-116. When various ethanol extract concentrations (7.8, 15.63, 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, and 1000 μg/mL) were tested against the cell lines, HCT-116's IC50, values were lower as compared to PCE. The IC50 values for HCT-116 and PCE cells ranged from 10.0 to 14.07 μg/mL and 92.9-216.9 μg/mL, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Ethanolic extract of S. trifasciata showed promising antibacterial and anticancer properties.

AB  - The clinical application of most natural antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) is hindered by their lack of a synergistic combination of high antibacterial efficacy, low toxicity, and stability, necessitating frequent complex modifications that incur significant labor and economic costs. Therefore, it is imperative to optimize the antibacterial properties of AMPs using some simplified approach. In this study, we designed a library of β-hairpin AMPs with identical β-turn sequences (-D-Pro-Gly-) and varying repetition units (IR, FR, and WK). Ultimately, candidate peptide G(RF)3 exhibited high antibacterial activity and low toxicity; however, its stability was compromised. Moreover, we synthesized the new analogue D-G(RF)3 by D-type amino acid substitution of G(RF)3, and D-G(RF)3 demonstrated concurrent high antibacterial activity, low toxicity, and remarkable stability. Interestingly, both G(RF)3 and D-G(RF)3 exerted bactericidal effects by disrupting the bacterial membrane. However, D-G(RF)3 displayed superior antibiofilm activity with a faster bactericidal rate compared to G(RF)3 and also showed enhanced synergy with antibiotics. Furthermore, D-G(RF)3 exhibited potent in vivo bactericidal activity without inducing drug resistance and has the potential to be a novel antibiotic alternative or adjuvant.

AB  - Environmental microbial pollution can potentially cause illnesses and deaths among human populations. Environmental factors such as geomorphology, land use, human activities, and seasonality could influence pathogen dissemination. This study performed a space-temporal analysis of Escherichia coli concentrations, virulence (eaeA, bfpA, stx2, aatA, and st), and resistance (tetA, blaTEM, blaOXA, Intl-1, Intl-2, sul-1, and sul-2) genes in surface water within the Virilla sub-watershed, Costa Rica. The research employs microbiological, geostatistical, and quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) techniques to evaluate the health risks associated with diarrheagenic E. coli. Samples collected monthly over a year were analyzed for fecal coliforms, E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, physicochemical parameters, and the presence of virulence and resistance genes. The geographically weighted regression model identified significant associations between the virulence and resistance genes presence and environmental factors influence such as land use, slope, altitude, and seasonal changes. The results show that urban and grazing land use significantly influence the presence of resistance genes, while human fecal pollution is associated with higher concentrations of virulence genes. Seasonal variations showed that wet seasons contributed to increased gene presence (number of positive samples) and diversity (variety of virulence and resistance genes) compared with dry season. The QMRA results indicated that the total health disease burden was higher than the benchmark for drinking water recommended by WHO (1.00 × 10

AB  - Betulin, a bioactive triterpenoid derived from Betulaceae bark with antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, holds great potential as a therapeutic agent. In this work, cationic sulfonium-modified betulin derivatives were synthesized to enhance their antibacterial efficacy for wound healing application. Mono- and dual S-alkylated sulfonium derivatives significantly outperformed betulin in antibacterial activity against pathogens such as S. aureus, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and E. coli. S-nonylated sulfonium betulin reduced the minimum inhibitory concentration of betulin against MRSA from 24 to 0.015 mM. The sulfonium modification enhanced cationic interactions, leading to bacterial membrane disruption. The derivatives expedited the process of wound healing by mitigating inflammation and exhibited satisfactory biosafety, proposing a viable approach to the development of antibacterial agents.

AB  - Amphotericin B (AmB) is one of the most effective antifungal drugs, with a strong, dose-dependent activity against most Candida and Aspergillus species responsible for life-threatening infections. However, AmB is severely toxic, which hinders its broad use. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate that prodrugging AmB considerably decreases AmB toxicity without affecting its fungicidal activity. For this purpose, we modified the AmB structure by attaching a designer phosphate promoiety, thereby switching off its mode of action and preventing its toxic effects. The original fungicidal activity of AmB was then restored upon prodrug activation by host plasma enzymes. These AmB prodrugs showed a safer toxicity profile than commercial AmB deoxycholate in Candida and Aspergillus species and significantly prolonged larval survival of infected Galleria mellonella larvae. Based on these findings, prodrugging toxic antifungals may be a viable strategy for broadening the antifungal arsenal, opening up opportunities for targeted prodrug design.

The in-vitro screening against bacterial strains (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhi) exhibited their antibacterial potential with many of the compounds showing inhibition range of 90-100 % at 200 μg/mL, against most of the tested strains. The MIC values of some of the compounds showed good antibacterial efficacy with values ranging from 32 to 128 μg/mL. Their bacterial growth inhibitory potential was further supported by disk diffusion and growth curve assays. Interestingly, one of the Schiff's bases (LT-SB7) displayed strong synergistic activity against E. coli and S. typhi with 16-64 folds reduction in MIC values. Additionally, it exhibited up to 85 % suppression of biofilm at

AB  - Rational modification of natural products plays a key role in drug discovery. Herein, a series of steroidal indole derivatives containing various substituents and steroidal skeletons were designed and synthesized with classical Fischer indole synthesis as a key step in an efficient synthetic route for the first time. The in vitro antibacterial activity of all the synthesized derivatives was evaluated against four Gram-positive strains including three Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Compound 11e displayed the most potent antibacterial activity (MIC = 1-2 μg/mL) with low cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity. Derivative 11e displayed more rapid bactericidal kinetic than vancomycin in the time-kill study and was less likely to induce bacterial resistance. Moreover, the preliminary antibacterial mechanism explorations indicated that compound 11e could effectively inhibit biofilm formation, promote the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, decrease bacterial metabolism, and destroy bacterial cell membranes to exert its antibacterial effects. The study of in vivo antibacterial activity suggested that compound 11e could significantly reduce the bacteria counts in a mouse subcutaneous infection model. These findings provided a bright hope for steroidal indole derivatives as promising antibacterial candidates to settle drug resistance.

AB  - Host-associated fecal indicator measurements can be coupled with quantitative microbial risk assessment to develop risk-based thresholds for recreational use of potential sewage-contaminated waters. These assessments require information on the relative concentrations of indicators and pathogens in discharged sewage, typically based on data collected from wastewater treatment plant influent samples. However, most untreated sewage releases occur from within the collection system itself (i.e. compromised sewer laterals, compromised gravity and force mains, sanitary sewer overflows), where these relationships may differ. This study therefore analyzed the concentrations of a selected reference pathogen (norovirus) and fecal indicator (HF183) in sewage samples from upper and lower segments of gravity sewage collection systems, wastewater pumpstations, and the influent and effluent of treatment plants, to characterize variability in their relative concentrations. Norovirus detection rates were lower and more variable in upper collection system samples due to the smaller population represented; whereas, HF183 was routinely detected at all sites with higher concentrations in the collection system compared to treatment plant influent, resulting in variable comparative relationships across sample locations (types). Mean HF183:NoV ratios ranged from 1.0 × 10

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The burden of acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI) attributable to natural water recreation in Canada is unknown. Understanding the burden can help prioritize public health interventions and resource allocation for reduction of disease. Our objectives were to compile estimates of AGI burden associated with natural water recreation, identify knowledge gaps in water recreation epidemiology, and evaluate methods applicable for developing a burden estimate for Canada. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of the literature. From a total of 2752 unique records identified, 35 met eligibility for inclusion. Articles were chosen if they examined burden in natural waterways, were written in English, and were based in countries of similar economic status to Canada in non-tropical regions. Burden was defined as either: incidence or prevalence, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), or economic cost. RESULTS: Swimming or wading were the predominant forms of recreation examined (n = 32/35; 91.4%). Waterways studied were primarily marine or coastal beaches (n = 24/35; 68.6%) and were located within or adjacent to urban areas (n = 29/35; 82.9%). The most common indicator for burden was incidence or prevalence (n = 30/35; 85.7%). Prospective cohort studies (n = 17/35; 48.6%) and predictive modelling based on microorganism concentrations (n = 9/35; 25.7%) were the most common methods of estimation. CONCLUSION: The review highlighted several knowledge gaps regarding recreational waterborne disease burden. Freshwater recreation, rural waterways, and recreational activities other than swimming and wading require further study. We propose that quantitative microbial risk assessment may be an appropriate, cost-effective method to estimate recreational waterborne disease burden in Canada.

AB  - As a member of the Convolvulaceae family, Convolvulus oxyphyllus is used in many medicinal contexts. The purpose of this study was to investigate the biological potency of plant methanolic extracts and determine the main bioactive components that give them their potencies. Using in vitro biological tests, the effects of plant extracts on cytotoxicity, antioxidant, and antibacterial activity were investigated. The results showed that C. oxyphyllus methanolic extracts exhibited potent antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Proteus vulgaris, as well as good antioxidant activity comparable to ascorbic acid. Methanolic leaf extract exhibited maximum cytotoxic activity against HepG2 cancer cells, producing cell cycle arrest at the S phase. In addition, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to further analyze chemical makeup of leaf extract. 3-Hydroxyphenyl acetic acid, quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol were among the bioactive substances discovered. In conclusion, C. oxyphyllus leaves extract showed encouraging antioxidant, antibacterial, and cytotoxic properties. More research is needed to determine C. oxyphyllus's therapeutic potential for treating liver cancer.

AB  - Acne vulgaris is a prevalent skin condition among adolescents, primarily instigated by over-colonization and subsequent inflammation triggered by Cutibacterium acnes. Although topical and oral antibiotics are standard treatments, they often lead to the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and are associated with undesirable side effects. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered a promising solution to these challenges. In this study, we aimed to develop novel short AMPs to combat C. acnes. By comparing sequences and abstracting the distribution of residue types of established AMPs, we derived a sequence template. Using this template, we crafted novel anti-C. acnes peptides comprising 13 amino acid residues. To enhance their potential therapeutic application, we designed a series of peptides by varying the number and position of the tryptophan residues. Among these peptides, DAP-7 and DAP-10 demonstrated potent antimicrobial activity against both antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant strains of C. acnes, with minimal cytotoxicity. The antimicrobial action of these peptides was attributed to their ability to target the bacterial membrane, resulting in permeabilization and rupture. Moreover, DAP-7 and DAP-10 effectively reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by C. acnes and remained stable for up to 12 h after exposure to proteases found in acne lesions. Notably, DAP-7 decreased the C. acnes colonies on the ears and significantly alleviated C. acnes-induced ear swelling in a mouse model. Our findings suggest that the DAP-7 and DAP-10 peptides hold promise as candidates for developing a new acne vulgaris treatment.

AB  - Drug-resistant bacterial infections have emerged as a new challenge in anti-infective treatment, posing a significant threat to public health. DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV (Topo IV) are promising targets for designing new antibiotics. Myrtus communis L. has long been used as a traditional herb for antisepsis and disinfection; however, the underlying mechanism of the antibacterial activity remains unclear. In this study, a class of novel myrtucommulone derivatives was synthesized and evaluated for DNA gyrase and Topo IV inhibitions. Analog 27 was the most potent DNA gyrase and Topo IV inhibitor. In bioactivity assays, molecule 27 exhibited a significant antibacterial effect against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Additionally, it exhibited rapid bactericidal properties, low toxicity, and low inducing bacterial resistance. It demonstrated synergistic effects with ofloxacin, amikacin, cefepime, and ceftazidime, which make it a potential candidate for antimicrobial application. This work will facilitate the future development of myrtucommulone-based DNA gyrase and Topo IV inhibitors as novel antimicrobials to combat the increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The burden of disease associated with acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI) in Canada is estimated to be ~ 20 million cases/year. One known risk factor for developing AGI is recreation in freshwater bodies such as lakes. The proportion of cases attributable to freshwater recreation in Canada, however, is currently unknown. The study objective was to estimate the risk of developing AGI from exposure to Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli O157:H7, norovirus, and Salmonella during freshwater recreation in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) was conducted to estimate the number of AGI cases per 1000 recreational events associated with freshwater recreation. QMRA utilizes four steps: hazard identification, exposure assessment, dose-response modelling, and risk characterization. A probabilistic model was developed using the following inputs accounting for uncertainty and variability: published data on pathogen prevalence and concentration in freshwaters in Ontario (hazard identification), recreator water ingestion volumes (exposure), pathogen-specific dose-response models, and ratios between numbers of infections and symptomatic disease cases to estimate illness risks (risk characterization). RESULTS: The mean estimated AGI risk associated with recreation ranged from 0.8 to 36.7 cases per 1000 swimmers (5th-95th probability interval: 0-226.3 cases/1000) which is in line with previous studies conducted in Lake Ontario, as well as prior QMRAs of freshwater recreation. Upper range predicted values exceeded the Health Canada guideline of less than 20 cases per 1000 recreators. CONCLUSION: This study shows that QMRA can be used to estimate disease risk in the absence of large-scale epidemiological studies. The results demonstrate a range of risk that is in line with exposure to pristine (low risk estimates) and more contaminated waters (high risk estimates) and capture the potential risk to vulnerable populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The lack of research on the dose-response relationship of adjuvants in reversing colistin resistance will lead to a lack of scientific theoretical basis for determining the dosage of adjuvants in clinical combination therapy plans or their compound formulations. OBJECTIVES: This study investigates the dose-response relationship of the deworming drug closantel (CST) on the reversal of colistin resistance in mcr-1-positive Escherichia coli (E. coli). METHODS: Firstly, the reversal effect of different concentrations of CST on colistin resistance in mcr-1-positive E. coli was analysed using broth microdilution method, checkerboard method and time-killing curves. Then, the inhibitory effect of CST on the development of colistin resistance, as well as the haemolytic and cytotoxic properties of CST, was analysed. Finally, the in vivo efficacy of the combination of CST and colistin was evaluated. RESULTS: Both the checkerboard assays and the time-killing curves indicate that there is a special dose-response relationship between CST and its reversal effect on colistin resistance, which is not concentration-dependent. High reversal efficiency can be achieved within a low concentration range. However, as the CST concentration increases, the ability to reverse colistin resistance remains unchanged or decreases, which resulted in a gradual decrease in reversal efficiency. Additionally, CST can inhibit the development of colistin resistance and reduce the cytotoxicity of colistin. Importantly, in a mouse model of E. coli infection, the combination of CST and colistin showed a significant therapeutic effect. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates a special dose-response relationship between CST and its reversal effect on colistin resistance, which was not concentration-dependent.

AB  - Worldwide, Aeromonas hydrophila (A. hydrophila) has become a significant foodborne pathogen, causing gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal infections in humans as well as severe economic losses in fish farms. Thus, we conducted this research in two experiments. The experiment 1 investigated the prevalence of A. hydrophila among Nile tilapia in different farms in Kafrelsheikh province and its pathogenicity by detecting some of its virulence genes before being used in the in vivo experiment. The experiment 2 was done to investigate the effect of dietary curcumin on growth performance, humoral immunity, antioxidants, and histopathology of Nile tilapia through a sixty-day feeding trial. Nile tilapia was divided into 3 groups, each in 3 replicates. Fish were given diets that included 0.0 (C, control), 1 % (10 g curcumin/kg diet; G1), and 2 % curcumin/kg diet (20 g curcumin/kg diet; G2). Moreover, the antibacterial effect of dietary curcumin against isolated bacteria in experiment 1 was investigated through experimental infection. The study's findings of experiment 1 indicated that the incidence of isolated A. hydrophila was 28 %. Moreover, the virulence aerolysin (aerA) and haemolysin (hlyA) genes were found in 100 % and 50 % of the isolates, respectively. The experiment 2 outcomes demonstrated that the growth-modulating impacts of dietary curcumin were notably noticed in final weight, feed intake, weight gain%, and specific growth rate without pathological lesions in the different organs. In addition, the white blood cell and lymphocyte counts significantly (P < 0.05) increased in Nile tilapia fed dietary curcumin. Similar improvements in humoral immunity (lysozyme and phagocytic activity) and antioxidants (catalase and superoxide dismutase) were seen in the 1 % curcumin group (G1). The experimental infection with a virulent strain of A. hydrophila that was previously isolated in experiment 1 showed a significant decrease in the morbidity and mortality rates in the 1 % curcumin treatment group (G1), followed by the 2 % group (G2). The present study concluded that under current experimental conditions, dietary curcumin at a dose of 10 g/kg diet proves effective, but the dose of 1 % may not be optimal for tilapia.

Peptide 20Ac exhibited about twofold the inhibitory potency of 19Ac and proved effective against both standard and morphothiadin (GLS4)-resistant HBV strains. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that despite their overlapping sequence, 19Ac and 20Ac bonded to different regions of the core protein, thereby inhibiting capsid assembly through distinct mechanisms. These peptides could serve as valuable seed compounds for the further development of HBV capsid inhibitors, including GLS4-resistant strains.

AB  - The rise of multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), necessitates the development of new antibacterial therapies. Antimicrobial peptides offer a promising alternative to conventional antibiotics due to their unique mechanisms of action. Gramicidin S exhibits potent bactericidal activity against S. aureus, however, high haemolytic toxicity currently limits its application to topical use. A new series of gramicidin S analogues is presented with rational modifications to the β-turn and β-strand regions, to reduce haemolytic and nephrotoxic effects, while preserving antibacterial potency. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for each analogue was determined against benchmark methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA clinical isolates, with toxicity characterised in vitro using human red blood cells and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293). Peptide 12 demonstrated a significant two-fold increase in antibacterial activity against both MSSA and MRSA (MIC: 2 μg/mL) compared to gramicidin S (MIC: 4 μg/mL), albeit with increased cytotoxicity. Similarly, peptide 15 showed exceptional efficacy (MIC: 3 μg/mL), but with reduced cytotoxicity, culminating in a two-fold improvement to the therapeutic index (TI) of gramicidin S. Peptides 14 (HC

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant global health challenge, with multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR-TB) strains posing severe threats to treatment efficacy. Linezolid, a key component of the BPaL (Bedaquiline, Pretomanid and Linezolid) regimen, has demonstrated substantial efficacy against MDR-TB and XDR-TB. However, its clinical utility is often limited by side effects such as myelosuppression and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibition, linked to its mechanism of action. This perspective centres on the structural toxicity relationship (STR) of Linezolid and its analogues, exploring modifications to the C-ring and C-5 position that aim to reduce these toxicities while maintaining or enhancing antibacterial activity. Several promising analogues have been identified that exhibit reduced myelosuppression and MAO inhibition, highlighting the potential for developing safer Linezolid derivatives. The findings underscore the importance of continued research into the structure toxicity relationships of oxazolidinones to improve the therapeutic profiles of these essential drugs in combating drug-resistant TB.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The potential application of vanillin as a fungicide has garnered significant attention in the agricultural product market and food industries. Consequently, a novel series of vanillin derivatives containing thiazole and hydrazone fragments were strategically designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their antifungal activity against six representative plant phytopathogenic fungi. RESULTS: In the in vitro antifungal assay, some title vanillin derivatives showed good antifungal activity against Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium solani, and Magnaporthe grisea. Significantly, compound 4a exhibited remarkable broad-spectrum fungistatic potency and displayed the most potent antifungal activity against B. cinerea and F. solani, with half maximal effective concentration (EC CONCLUSION: Modification of vanillin through electron-withdrawing group substitution and hydrophobic substitution, followed by condensation with thiazole-4-carbohydrazide, could result in highly active antifungal derivatives. Among them, compound 4a, which exhibited excellent inhibitory activities in vitro and in vivo, could potentially serve as a lead compound. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Increasing antimicrobial resistance underscores the urgent need for new antibiotics with unique mechanisms. Type I signal peptidase (SPase I) is crucial for bacterial survival and a promising target for antibiotics. Herein we designed and synthesized innovative tetrahydroacridine-9-carboxylic acid derivatives by optimizing the initial hit compound SP11 based on virtual screening. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies and bioactivity assessments identified compound C09 as a standout, showing excellent in vitro antimicrobial activity against MRSA and other multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens. C09 targets SPase I with a favorable affinity, disrupts bacterial cell membranes, and eradicates biofilms, reducing resistance risk. In vivo tests in a murine MRSA skin infection model demonstrated significant efficacy. Additionally, C09 has good liver microsome metabolic stability, safe hemolytic activity and mammalian cytotoxicity, as well as a good in vivo safety profile. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of tetrahydroacridine-9-carboxylic acid derivatives as a novel class of antibiotics against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria.

AB  - In this article, we highlight novel components of foodborne pathogens that influence their response, physiology, adaptation, and survival in the face of diverse stresses, and consequently have implications for their transmission in the food chain and their pathogenesis. Recent insights into the role of bacteriophages/prophages, bacterial extracellular vesicles, and bacterial microcompartments, which make up the emerging field we coined as "nano in micro," are presented, together with the role of understudied food-relevant substrates in pathogen fitness and virulence. These new insights also lead to reflections on generally adopted laboratory conditions in the long-standing research field of adaptive stress response in foodborne pathogens. In addition, selected examples of the impact of diet and microbiota on intestinal colonization and host invasion are discussed. A final section on risk assessment presents an overview of tools for (kinetic) data modeling and perspectives for the implementation of information derived from whole-genome sequencing, combined with advancements in dose-response models and exposure assessments.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) possess broad-spectrum antibacterial properties and low resistance development, making them promising candidates for new antibacterial drugs. Incorporating fatty acid chains into AMPs can increase their hydrophobicity, strengthen membrane affinity, and improve their antibacterial effectiveness and stability. This study introduces fatty acid chains of varying lengths into the naturally derived antimicrobial peptide B1. These modified peptides were evaluated for their antibacterial activity, stability, and biocompatibility to identify the optimal chain length for analogues. The analogues B1-C6 and B1-C8 exhibited significantly enhanced antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumonia), demonstrating better stability and biocompatibility. Following acute toxicity and skin irritation tests on mice, further in vivo tests using a mouse skin inflammation model showed that these peptides significantly restrain bacterial growth and promote wound healing. The skin healing rate in the high-concentration group reached 95.92%, 97.35% 98.42% and 98.17%, respectively. These findings indicated that optimizing the hydrophobic-hydrophilic balance in AMPs is crucial for maximizing their therapeutic potential. This research offers a promising approach for designing effective AMPs to treat infections caused by S. aureus and K. pneumoniae.

AB  - The misuse and abuse of antibiotics have led to the increase of drug resistance and the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria. Therefore, it is an urgent need to develop novel antimicrobial agents to address this problem. Natural products (NPs) could provide an effective strategy for the discovery of drug due to their wide range of source and biological activities. Ursolic acid (UA) is a naturally occurring compound known for its wide range of biological properties. In this study, a series of UA derivatives were rationally designed and synthesized by incorporating antibacterial potential fragments of benzenesulfonamide and indole, with the aim of obtaining novel UA derivatives for the treatment of bacterial infections. Based on the preliminary screening, UA derivatives 27 (yield of 26 %), containing 4-chlorobenzenesulfonamide and 6-carboxyindole pharmacophores, as well as 34 (yield of 42 %), containing 4-carboxybenzenesulfonamide and unsubstituted indole pharmacophores, were identified as promising antibacterial agents against Staphylococcus aureus, especially for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), possessing MICs of 1 μM. Furthermore, both of them also displayed low hemolytic activity, non-resistance, and low-toxicity to mammalian cells. In addition, further mechanistic studies revealed that 27 and 34 were able to inhibit and eliminate MRSA biofilm formation, affecting the permeability of bacterial cell membrane, leading to increase intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ultimately inducing bacterial death. Notably, 27 and 34 also showed promising in vivo efficacy against MRSA in a mouse wound model. These results suggested that 27 and 34 should have promising applications against MRSA infection.

AB  - A novel, palatable butyric acid-rich triglyceride oil has been developed and is available as a food supplement for adults in the United States and Canada. A program of safety studies was conducted with butyric acid-rich triglyceride oil for the pediatric population. The oil was tested in a microbial reverse mutation assay Ames Test OECD471 (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) in which all bacterial strains showed negative responses over the complete dose range in two independently repeated experiments. All values were within the laboratory historical control data ranges. Further, data from the human lymphocyte micronucleus assay (OECD487) in the presence or absence of a metabolic activator (S9-mix), the oil did not induce a biologically relevant increase in the number of binucleated cells with micronuclei; therefore, the oil is considered not to be clastogenic or aneugenic. In a 90-day rat repeat dose toxicity study (OECD408), there were no unscheduled deaths, no treatment-related clinical signs, or effects on body weight and body weight gain, food consumption, ophthalmology, FOB parameters (including motor activity), clinical chemistry including thyroid hormones, and sperm parameters. There were no related organ weight changes, macroscopic or microscopic findings. In an extended one-generation reproductive toxicology study (EOGRTS) OECD443, there were no biologically important changes in body weight or body weight gain observed in the P generation male rats during the dosing period. At the end of the dosing period, the mean body weights in the male rats were 98% and 98% of the control group value in the 3720 and 4650 mg/kg/day dose groups, respectively. No biologically important changes in maternal body weights or body weight gains were observed during the premating, gestation, or lactation periods at dose levels up to and including 4650 mg/kg/day. Clinical signs observed in the P generation males and females were within the historical data ranges and not test substance related. There were no test substance-related changes in any other tested outcomes analyzed in the P generation males and females at doses up to and including 4650 mg/kg/day. In the F1 Generation, preweaning clinical signs observed in the males and females were within the historical data ranges and not test article related. There were no statistically significant or biologically relevant abnormalities in any of the parameters analyzed throughout the preweaning period at maternal dose levels up to and including 4650 mg/kg/day. In the postweaning period, there were also no clinical signs observed in males and females; all were within the historical data ranges and not test article related. There were no statistically significant or biologically relevant abnormalities in any of the parameters analyzed throughout the postweaning period at maternal dose levels up to and including 4650 mg/kg/day including body weights. Taken together, data from these toxicity studies show that butyric acid-rich triglyceride oil is extremely safe with a "no observed adverse effect level" (NOAEL) considered to be 4650 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested.

AB  - The composition of feed significantly influences the growth performance and gut microbiota of broiler chicks, impacting their overall health and productivity. This study aimed to investigate the effects of cassava pellets and enzymes supplementation on the growth performance, meat quality, serum biochemical indices, and cecal microbial community of broiler chicks. A total of 144 healthy 1-day-old AA broilers were randomly assigned to six dietary groups: basal diet (K1), basal diet + 5 % cassava pellets (K2), basal diet + 10 % cassava pellets (K3), basal diet + 20 % cassava pellets (K4), basal diet + 20 % cassava pellets + 0.3 % tannase (K5), and basal diet + 20 % cassava pellets + 0.3 % tannase + 2500 U/kg α-amylase (K6). At 21 days, growth performance, meat quality, serum biochemical indices, and cecal microbial composition were analyzed. Compared to K1, the end weight was significantly higher in the K3 and K5 groups (P < 0.05); average daily weight gain was significantly higher in the K3 and K6 groups (P < 0.05); and the feed-to-weight ratio was lower in the K3 group (P < 0.05). Cecal microbiota analysis revealed that the Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were the dominant phyla. Alpha diversity showed a significant increase in the Chao index in the K3 group and in the Shannon and Simpson indices in the K6 group compared to the K1 group (P < 0.05). Beta diversity indicated similar microbial compositions across groups. LEfSe analysis showed increased numbers of specific bacteria in treated groups. Serum analysis revealed significantly higher ALT levels in the K4 group and higher IBIL levels in the K5 group (P < 0.05), with Bacteroides plebeius and Megamonas positively correlated with ALT (P < 0.05). The addition of 10 % cassava pellets to the diet improved the growth performance and meat quality of broilers from 1 to 21 days of age and enhanced the microbial composition, providing valuable insights for optimizing broiler diets and improving economic returns.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the piperacillin disposition and optimize the dosing regimens for infants and children with pneumonia. METHODS: An opportunistic sampling strategy was used in this pharmacokinetic study. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to measure the concentrations of piperacillin in plasma samples. A population pharmacokinetic model was conducted using NONMEM. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetic data of 90 samples from 64 infants and children with pneumonia (age range: 0.09-1.72 years for infants and 2.12-11.10 years for children) were available. A two-compartment model with first-order elimination was the most suitable model to describe the population pharmacokinetics of piperacillin. A covariate analysis indicated that body weight and age were significant factors affecting clearance. Monte Carlo simulations showed that a 50-mg/kg every 8 h or every 12 h dosing regimen results in underdosing. Results both in infants and children showed that an extended infusion (3 h) of various dosing regimens (80, 100, or 130 mg/kg) three times daily or a 300-mg/kg continuous infusion can reach a therapeutic level based on the chosen target for the probability of target attainment threshold of 70%, 80%, and 90% at minimum inhibitory concentration breakpoints of 8 mg/L and 16 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: A population pharmacokinetic model was obtained to evaluate the disposition of piperacillin, and the optimal dosing regimens were provided for use in infants and children with pneumonia.

AB  - Homalomena aromatica Schott is a valuable medicinal aromatic plant having wide range of applications in ethnobotany, pharmacology, perfumery and flavor industry. Traditionally, various part of H. aromatica such as leaves and rhizomes were applied to treat joint pain, skin diseases, colds, asthma, diarrhea, and jaundice. Whole herbs extracts are used to address muscle weakness, rheumatism, and allergies, purify the blood, treat deafness, and promote wound healing, especially in postpartum women. The present study is subjected to assess anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, tyrosinase inhibitory, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), antimicrobial, and genotoxic efficacies of H. aromatica rhizome essential oil (HAEO). To validate the findings of biological assays, in silico methods including Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances (PASS) tool, target prediction, and molecular docking were employed. Using Clevenger apparatus dry rhizome of HAEO was extracted. The chemical profiling was performed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) where HAEO yield was 1.09% ± 0.641% (v/w) with 12 compounds where linalool was identified as major compound (76.29%). Anti-inflammatory activity showed IC

AB  - Gut microbiota composition has been implicated in surgical site complications after colorectal cancer surgery. Antibiotics affect gut microbiota, but evidence for a role in surgical site complications is inconclusive. We aimed to investigate use of prescription antibiotics during the years before surgery in relation to the risk of surgical site infections, including anastomotic leakage, within 30 days after surgery. Cardiovascular/neurological complications and the urinary antiseptic methenamine hippurate, for which there is no clear link with the microbiota, were used as negative controls. We conducted a patient cohort study using complete population data from Swedish national registers between 2005 and 2020. The final study population comprised 26,527 colon cancer and 12,312 rectal cancer cases with a 4.5 year exposure window. In colon cancer patients, antibiotics use was associated with a higher risk of surgical site infections (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for any versus no use = 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-1.33) and anastomotic leakage in particular (aOR =1.19, 95% CI 1.03-1.36), both with dose-response relationships for increasing cumulative antibiotics use (P

AB  - The surge in multidrug resistance in Staphylococcus aureus is the pressing need to identify novel alternatives to combat antimicrobial resistance effectively. Bakuchiol is a bioactive prenylated phenolic meroterpene largely abundant in the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia. In this study, we present the biological assessment of bakuchiol derived from P. corylifolia as an antimicrobial agent. S. aureus, a significant opportunistic pathogen, attracts global concern for its biofilm formation and resilience against numerous antibiotics, escaping antibiotic pressure. The primary screening of bakuchiol as an antimicrobial agent against S. aureus delineated its potential as a strong bactericidal agent with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 2 and 8 µg/mL, respectively. Importantly, bakuchiol also exhibited low toxicity against HepG2 cells, showing a favorable selectivity index (SI) of 14.4. Furthermore, bakuchiol demonstrated comparable activity (MIC = 2 µg/mL) against a laboratory-generated ciprofloxacin-resistant mutant of S. aureus. Bakuchiol could significantly inhibit the biofilm formation of S. aureus in a dose-dependent manner with minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC)

AB  - AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) is a crucial regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, involved in various cellular processes, including viral infection. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are essential in regulating gene transcription through the process of histone deacetylation and have become promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of cancer and viral infections. In this study, several AAK1/HDACs dual inhibitors based on our previous reported compounds were designed and synthesized, and the antiviral activity of these dual inhibitors were evaluated. Among them, compound 12 showed remarkable dual inhibitory activity against both AAK1 and HDACs, with IC

AB  - Biosolids can provide a nutrient rich soil amendment, particularly for poor soils and semi-arid or drought-prone areas. However, there are concerns that sludge and biosolids could be a source of propagation and exposure to AMR determinants such as antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB), and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). To inform risk assessment efforts, a systematic literature review was performed to build a comprehensive spreadsheet database of ARB and ARG concentrations in biosolids (and some sludges specified as intended for land application), along with 69 other quantitative and qualitative meta-data fields from 68 published studies describing sampling information and processing methods that can be used for modeling purposes. Mean ARG concentrations per gram in positive samples of biosolids ranged from -5.7 log

AB  - A series of novel derivatives of Poliacetylene Glycosides (PAGs) were synthesized, and their antiproliferative and antiviral properties were evaluated. Starting from D-(+)-glucose pentaacetate as a precursor, a commercially available and low-cost starting material, three different strategies were attempted to synthesize the new PAGs, and the desired compounds were obtained in high overall yields after only three steps. The synthesized PAGs exhibited antitumoral activity in concentrations ranging from 68-878 μM and antiviral activities in concentrations ranging from 71-794 μM. Some preliminary structure-activity relationships are also discussed.

AB  - In recent years, selenocompounds have gained increasing attention as potential anticancer and antibacterial agents. Several selenoderivatives have been confirmed to act as MDR efflux pump inhibitors, based on their in vitro results against the bacterial AcrAB-TolC system and the cancer MDR efflux pump P-glycoprotein. Efflux pumps can contribute directly or indirectly to the virulence of bacteria, as they can reduce the intracellular concentration of antibacterial substances by expelling them out of the cell. The present work aims to study the antibacterial and efflux pump inhibiting properties of four families of selenoesters, namely aspirin-selenoesters, phenone-selenoesters, hydroxy-selenoesters, and benzyl-selenoesters. The real-time ethidium bromide accumulation assay confirmed that these derivatives inhibited the efflux systems of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) without exerting any antibacterial effect. The relative expression of efflux pump gene of NorA transporter was also monitored in the presence of the most potent derivatives on reference S. aureus, finding that these derivatives could change the expression of the tested efflux pump gene. Regarding the anti-biofilm activity, aspirin-selenoesters, benzyl-selenoesters, and hydroxy-selenoesters could efficiently inhibit the biofilm production of the MRSA strain. It can be concluded that selenocompounds could act as efflux pump inhibitors, thus reducing the virulence of biofilm-producing bacteria.

Antibacterial and antibiofilm activity of new compounds was evaluated against six microbial strains (S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa). All synthesized ammonium salts displayed antibacterial activity with MIC values ranging from 5.0 to 25.0 μg/mL. In addition, most compounds showed strong inhibition of biofilm formation of S. aureus ATCC 25923, P. aeruginosa PA01, and colistin-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA) at a concentration of 5.0 μg/mL. Ammonium salt 3 showed 100 % inhibitory activity against all tested bacterial biofilms except that of colistin-resistant S. aureus (CRSA).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Oral corticosteroids (OCS) are used to manage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations but are associated with adverse outcomes that may increase healthcare resource utilization and costs. We compared attendance/costs associated with OCS-related adverse outcomes in patients who ever used OCS versus those who never used OCS and examined associations between cumulative OCS exposure and attendance/costs. METHODS: This direct matched observational cohort study used the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD database (data range 1987-2019). Patients with a COPD diagnosis on/after April 1, 2003, and Hospital Episode Statistics linkage were included. Emergency room, specialist or primary care outpatient, and inpatient attendance were analyzed. Costs, estimated using Health and Social Care 2019 and National Health Service Reference Costs 2019-2020 reports, were adjusted for sex, age, exacerbation number, and inhaler type used in the 12 months before index date. RESULTS: The OCS cohort had higher annualized disease-specific (excluding respiratory) total attendance/costs versus the non-OCS cohort (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) ranging from 37% (1.37 [1.31, 1.43]) for emergency room attendances to 149% (2.49 [2.36, 2.63]) for specialist consultations. Disease-specific (excluding respiratory) attendance/costs increased in a positive dose-response relationship for most attendance categories versus the < 0.5 g reference dose. For the 0.5 to < 1.0 g cumulative dose category, the greatest increases in disease-specific (excluding respiratory) attendance/costs occurred for primary care consultations (aIRR [95% CI] 1.38 [1.32, 1.44]). For the ≥ 10 g cumulative dose category, the greatest increases were observed for primary care consultations (aIRR [95% CI] 2.83 [2.66, 3.00]), non-elective long stays (≥ 2 days; 2.54 [2.15, 2.99]), and non-elective short stays (≤ 1 day; 2.51 [2.12, 2.98]). Similar findings were observed for all-cause attendance/costs. CONCLUSION: Among patients with COPD, OCS-related adverse outcomes were associated with higher attendance and costs, with a positive dose-response relationship.

AB  - In recent years salinomycin has emerged as a promising anticancer drug. Many literature reports have proved its remarkable antiproliferative activity. Moreover, chemical modifications of salinomycin lead to analogues with even higher cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines and a better selectivity index for malignant cells than those of the unmodified compound or a standard anticancer drug such as doxorubicin. In this paper we report the synthesis of a series of twelve novel salinomycin conjugates and their characterization by spectroscopic and spectrometric methods. Salinomycin was conjugated with different triphenylphosphonium cations in order to find out whether the conjugation with mitochondrial targeting vectors would have a beneficial impact on biological properties. Salinomycin and its novel conjugates were tested to determine their in vitro antiproliferative and antimicrobial activity. Taking into account the presence of triphenylphosphonium moiety, the impact of the obtained analogues on mitochondria activity was evaluated by MitoTrackers dyes, furthermore their apoptosis effect and cell cycle arrest were assessed. In addition, the changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential were measured and the ability to generate reactive oxygen species was assessed. Finally, we conducted biophysical studies to investigate the impact of the obtained salinomycin analogues on mitochondrial respiration rates and their electrophysiological properties. Results of this study have proved that conjugation of salinomycin with phosphonium cations leads to promising results in the search for promising anticancer agents.

AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) remains a significant global health threat, necessitating the development of new therapeutic agents. Pleuromutilin derivatives offer a promising solution due to their potent antibacterial activity, particularly against Gram-positive bacteria such as MRSA. In this study, we synthesized a series of pleuromutilin derivatives with phenol linker containing C14 side chains and evaluated in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities. Several compounds showed potent activity against MRSA and Staphylococcus aureus with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) as low as 0.03125 μg/mL. In particular, compounds a4 and b4 showed rapid bactericidal activity, significantly reducing MRSA loads in time-kill kinetics and exhibiting slower resistance development compared to tiamulin. In vivo, compound a4 showed superior efficacy in reducing MRSA-induced lung damage in a mouse model at a lower effective dose (ED50 = 6.48 mg/kg) compared to tiamulin (ED50 = 11.38 mg/kg). Molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies also showed that compound a4 binds strongly to the ribosomal peptidyl transferase center (PTC), a key target for pleuromutilin derivatives. These results suggest that compound a4, with its enhanced antibacterial activity and low resistance potential, is a promising candidate for further development as an effective treatment for MRSA infections.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance has emerged as a pressing global health issue. Polymyxin E, commonly regarded as a clinically important antibiotic, faces limitations due to its dose-dependent toxicity. A crucial strategy to combat this is the development of an antibiotic adjuvant to enhance efficacy while reducing dosage. Screening from our extensive in-house compound library, KJ1071 emerged as a promising adjuvant candidate for polymyxin E. Subsequent structure-activity relationship studies led to the discovery of compound A35, which demonstrated superior synergistic activity. However, its limited aqueous solubility posed challenges for biological experiments. To address this, we carried out a structural derivatization aimed at enhancing its solubility. The amino acid derivative A59 notably improved aqueous solubility to 3.237 mg/mL, a substantial 3237-fold increase compared to compound A35. Moreover, A59 amplified the efficacy of polymyxin E in eradicating a variety of Gram-negative bacteria, including certain clinical strains that are resistant to polymyxin E. The mechanism studies indicated that A59 might target the bacterial membrane. These findings suggest that the discovery of this innovative scaffold could provide critical insights for new adjuvant therapies.

AB  - Influenza virus is a kind of respiratory pathogen with high morbidity and mortality, which still threatens human health. Existing anti-influenza drugs have various limitations, such as the inability to alleviate body injury and side effects. There remains an urgent need to develop a novel antiviral drug to efficiently inhibit viral infection while avoiding body injury. A series of 2-aminoindole derivatives were synthesized via the TMSOTf-catalyzed reactions of N-arylynamides with sulfilimines and evaluated for their anti-influenza virus activity. The experimental results showed that 2-aminoindole 3h had significant antiviral activity (EC

AB  - The present work investigates the long-term effects of continuous low dose-rate (20 mGy/day to total doses of 1-8 Gy) gamma-ray exposure on the hematopoietic cells of specific pathogen-free C3H/HeN mice. Peripheral white blood cell (WBC) counts decreased on days 206, 471, and 486, with no significant changes in red blood cell (RBC) and platelet (PLT) counts. The number of colony forming units (CFU-S and CFU-GM) in the bone marrow and spleen from irradiated mice decreased with increasing total dose on day-12 and day-7. The decrease in bone marrow CFU-S persisted throughout the 400-day irradiation period and did not show any recovery up to 210 days postirradiation. These findings suggest that the effects of low-dose-rate (LDR) radiation on the hematopoietic system remain long after the 400-day irradiation was completed. Further investigation showed no significant difference in life spans of non-irradiated W/Wv (c-kit-deficient) mice inoculated with hematopoietic stem cells from irradiated (20 mGy/day for 400 days) or nonirradiated wild-type mice. These results suggest that the effects of continuous low-dose-rate irradiation are more pronounced in hematopoietic stromal cells than in HSCs themselves.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine whether environmental enrichments (EE) can mitigate the adverse effects of chronic low-dose-rate radiation exposure in mice. Female B6C3F1 mice were continuously exposed to 20 mGy d-1 gamma-rays under specific-pathogen-free conditions since 8 weeks of age for 400 d. After completion of the radiation exposure, OV3121 cells, derived from an ovarian granulosa cell tumor, were inoculated subcutaneously alongside age-matched non-irradiated control mice. Irradiated mice were shown to have a significantly reduced ability to eliminate inoculated tumors. The results indicate that EE may be able to mitigate the adverse effects of low-dose-rate radiation exposure, but the effects vary greatly and are complex depending on the type of EE.

AB  - A series of Triclosan-based hybrids and their Schiff base derivatives with isoniazid were designed through in silico modeling and synthesized using copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction. These compounds were then evaluated against both Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and Mycobacterium abscessus (Mab). However, none of the synthesized hybrids exhibited significant growth inhibition, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values consistently exceeding 100 µg/mL. To further investigate these findings, we conducted mechanistic studies including thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and UV-vis stability tests. TGA demonstrated thermal stability of the Schiff bases up to 270°C, while UV-vis analysis confirmed their chemical resilience across a wide pH spectrum, showing resistance to hydrolysis under acidic and basic conditions. The lack of observed antimicrobial activity may be attributed to the high lipophilicity of these molecules, as indicated by LogP values exceeding 5, which could limit their bioavailability. These findings suggest that although combining triclosan and isoniazid holds potential, further optimization of this hybrid strategy is necessary to improve efficacy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As the number of HIV-infected patients increased, the number of patients requiring general surgery has subsequently increased. However, impairment of immune function due to HIV infection increases the risk of postoperative surgical-site infection and significant harm to patient health. This study aimed to examine the risk factors for surgical-site infection after general surgery. METHODS: The patients' data were from Zunyi fourth hospital medical information system. Machine learning based Boruta algorithm were used for variable screening. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression and restricted cubic spline analysis were performed to examine the relationship between significant variables and surgical-site infection. RESULTS: A total of 125 general surgery postoperative HIV-infected patients participated in the study. Surgical-site pathogen culture identified Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and mixed bacteria as the three most common pathogens causing Surgical-site infection. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis to adjust for risk factors identified type III surgical incision (OR = 9.92, 95% CI = 1.28-76.75) and elevated preoperative white blood cell (WBC) count (OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.12-1.51) as independent risk factors for postoperative surgical-site infection, whereas CD4 + T lymphocyte count greater than 400 cells/µL was identified as a protective factor (OR = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.09-0.60) while. The restricted cubic spline analysis results directly reflected the dose-response relationship between continuous variables and postoperative surgical-site infection. CONCLUSIONS: Type III incision and an elevated WBC count pose a higher risk of postoperative surgical-site infection. A CD4 + T lymphocyte counts greater than 400 cells/µL provided a protective effect of lower risk of surgical site infection. Preoperative serum neutrophil percentage, albumin level, red blood cell count, and serum urea level within a specific range were beneficial in reducing the risk of incisional infections. Our research provides a theoretical basis for clinical practice.

AB  - Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease, and is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb). More than 1 billion people worldwide are thought to harbor an M.tb infection. The multidrug therapy that represents the current standard of care requires a minimum of four months of dosing and drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis treatment regimens are significantly longer. Inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (GuaB) is the enzyme that performs the rate-limiting step in de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthesis that is critical for growth and viability of bacteria including M.tb. The development of a novel antibiotic that inhibits GuaB could combine with existing therapies in novel ways and thereby contribute to effective therapeutic regimens for the treatment of tuberculosis. Here we describe the discovery of structurally distinct small molecule GuaB inhibitors that are potent against M.tb H37Ra and H37Rv strains and have desirable safety and ADME profiles.

AB  - Invasive fungal infections have become a serious public health problem. To tackle the challenges of limited efficacy in antifungal therapy and severe drug resistance, antifungal drugs with new mechanisms of action are urgently needed. Our previous study identified JIB-04 to be an inhibitor of fungal histone demethylase (HDM). To promote target validation and inhibitor design, herein a series of new JIB-04 derivatives were designed and synthesized. After the establishment of structure-activity relationship, compound A4 was identified to possess potent antifungal activity against Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida auris. Compared to lead compound JIB-04, compound A4 was a more potent HDM inhibitor and exhibited better water solubility, virulence factors inhibitory activity and in vivo antifungal potency. Collectively, this study further confirmed that fungal HDMs were potential antifungal targets and compound A4 was a promising antifungal lead compound.

AB  - Sn(IV) complex of N-Confused Porphyrin (Sn(IV)-NCP) has been prepared and characterized by several spectroscopic techniques to verify its structure and purity. Sn(IV)-NCP shows a red shift in both the Soret and Q bands compared to the free base NCTPP. The last Q band appears in the NIR region. Based on these characteristics, we investigated the antiproliferative properties and antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (a-PDT) efficiency of Sn(IV)-NCP against the bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Further, we investigated the photodynamic activity of Sn (IV)-NCP against Michigan cancer foundation-7 (MCF-7) cancer cells, to assess its potential as an effective therapeutic agent. Treated MCF-7 cells with the compound show cytotoxic effects as compared to the untreated ones. At a higher concentration (128 μg/ml), Sn(IV)-NCP exhibited 90 % inhibition, while at a lower concentration (32 μg/ml), it showed 70 % inhibition in MCF-7 cells. The IC

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSES: Non-invasive optimal vessel analysis quantitative magnetic resonance angiography (NOVA-QMRA) has emerged as a valuable tool to characterize cerebral hemodynamics in intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD). Our aim was to explore the eventual correlation between volume flow rate (VFR) measured via NOVA-QMRA and signal intensity ratio (SIR) of time-of-flight (TOF) MRA in M1- and P2-segments bilaterally in patients with unilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with acute, subacute or chronic unilaterall ICA occlusion receiving NOVA-QMRA between June 2019 and June 2021 were retrospectively included. In bilateral M1- and P2-segments VFR was assessed by means of NOVA-QMRA and a region of interest (ROI) was selected to measure TOF SIR. A correlation between TOF SIR and VFR was tested by means of Pearson correlation coefficient. Mean difference of TOF SIR and VFR between ipsilateral (to occluded ICA) and contralateral M1- and P2-segments was analyzed using a two-sided Welch's t test. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients with unilateral ICA occlusion were included (acute: 28; subacute: 8; chronic: 19). Both ipsilateral (r = 0.536, p < 0.001) and contralateral (r = 0.757, p < 0.001) TOF SIR correlated significantly with NOVA VFR. This observation proved especially true for patients with chronic ICA occlusion. Both VFR (165.18 vs 110.60, p < 0.001) and TOF SIR (4.96 vs 2.70, p < 0.001) were higher in contralateral than ipsilateral M1-segments; whereas, the contrary was observed for P2-segments (VFR 72.35 vs 102.12, p < 0.001, TOF SIR 2.87 vs 3.39, p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: The study results showed that TOF SIR significantly correlated with phase-contrast derived flow volume in patients with symptomatic ICA occlusion. This correlation remains the same regardless of the stage of the ischemic stroke (acute vs subacute vs chronic). Furthermore, significantly high VFR and TOF SIR in ipsilateral P2-segments may provide evidence of leptomeningeal collateralization in acute patients. Standardly performed TOF SIR Sequences might be of help for a qualitative evaluation of the flow in M1- and P2-segments in patients with unilateral ICA occlusions. NOVA QMRA allows precise quantitative measurements of the flow in cerebral vessels.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a pressing global health challenge that necessitates the search for novel antimicrobial agents and synthetic methodologies. This study investigates the synthesis and antimicrobial efficacy of 25 novel 1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine derivatives, catalyzed by Amla (Phyllanthus emblica) fruit juice, which is rich in organic acids and polyphenolic compounds, thus serving as an environmentally sustainable catalyst, in adherence to green chemistry principles. The synthesis is achieved through a one-pot, solvent-free process that yields high quantities of the desired compounds in significantly less time compared to traditional methods. Comprehensive antimicrobial evaluation was conducted against a range of clinically relevant microorganisms, including Chromobacterium violaceum, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus niger. Concurrently, cytotoxic assays were performed on HEK-293 cells, to assess safety profiles, revealing that compounds B-1, B-6, B-7, B-14 and B-15 exhibited potent antimicrobial activity while maintaining low cytotoxicity and high cell viability. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of the synthesized compounds in combatting infectious diseases and addressing the challenges posed by AMR, highlighting the critical importance of dose optimization in therapeutic applications. This study combats contagious diseases, mitigates AMR challenges and contributes significantly to the field of antimicrobial drug discovery, emphasizing the need for sustainable synthetic strategies that align with future pharmaceutical endeavors. Our research not only advances the understanding of these novel compounds but also supports ongoing efforts to develop safe and effective therapies against resistant pathogens.

AB  - Human enteric viruses, such as norovirus, adenovirus, rotavirus, and enterovirus, are crucial targets in controlling biological contamination in water systems worldwide. Due to their small size and low concentrations in water, effective virus concentration and detection methods are essential for ensuring microbial safety. This paper reviews the typical and innovative methods for concentrating and detecting human enteric viruses, highlights viral contamination levels across different water bodies, and discusses the removal efficiencies of virus through various treatment technologies. The application and current gaps of quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) for evaluating the risks of human enteric viruses is also explored. Innovative methods such as digital polymerase chain reaction and isothermal amplification show promise in sensitivity and convenience, however, distinguishing between infectious and non-infectious viruses should be a key focus of future detection techniques.

AB  - Fission yeast is an excellent model organism in which to study mammalian drug sensitivities. In addition to building a mechanistic picture of drug effect, fission yeast screens may be valuable in determining compounds that show synthetic lethality effects. While compounds might be screened for a variety of phenotypes, an effective method is to detect the proliferative effects of a new compound on a yeast culture. This is traditionally performed in acute viability assays or spot tests; both methods require some knowledge of concentration to observe an effect. Mammalian cell culture experiments that assess proliferation to indicate drug dose and effect are well described. However, differences between S. pombe growth characteristics and mammalian cells mean that importing a mammalian viability assay requires consideration of potential effects on fission yeast biology. We describe the half-maximum inhibitory (IC50) dose as a method of rapid proliferation effect screening. IC50 determination is performed on liquid cultures in 96-well plates and may be developed for initial compound library uses or in synthetic lethality screening of drug effects.

AB  - Green synthesis of nanoparticles has become a significant area of research, driven by the demand for sustainable, economical, and environmentally friendly processes, particularly in biomedical applications. In this study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were produced using 10 g of Couroupita guianensis flower extract through a straightforward and environmentally friendly method. The biosynthesized AgNPs were characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, XRD, FTIR, SEM, and EDS techniques, confirming their successful formation and structural properties. The antibacterial efficacy of the AgNPs was assessed against Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes, achieving 99.5% inactivation for E. coli and 99.3% inactivation for L. monocytogenes after 120 min of visible light exposure. Additionally, the AgNPs showed notable anticancer effects against breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231), displaying a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability, with reductions of 15%, 30%, 72%, and 86% observed at concentrations of 25, 50, 75, and 100 μg/mL, respectively. The spherical morphology of the synthesized AgNPs contributed to enhanced interactions with bacterial and cancer cells, underpinning their effectiveness. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying these antibacterial and anticancer effects were analyzed, highlighting the unique phytochemical properties of the extract that assist in biosynthesis and activity enhancement. These findings suggest that green-synthesized AgNPs derived from C. guianensis flower extract hold significant potential for use in biomedical applications, particularly in antibacterial and anticancer therapies.

AB  - Largemouth bass ranavirus (LMBRaV), also known as largemouth bass virus (LMBV), is a highly damaging viral pathogen that causes widespread mortality in cultured largemouth bass and poses a significant threat to the farming industry in China. However, there is a paucity of effective preventive methods for this disease by LMBRaV. Research has established that herbal extracts possess antiviral activity, potentially exerting a controlling effect on viruses in aquaculture. Therefore, the identification of simple and structurally safe herbal extract immunomodulators is critical for largemouth bass health and development. Rhein, an herbal compound, exhibits a broad spectrum of pharmacological effects in herbal medicine. This study aimed to evaluate the properties and effects of rhein against LMBRaV in epithelioma papilloma cyprinid (EPC) and largemouth bass. In vitro CCK-8 assays were performed to determine the highest safe concentrations. Significantly, 50 mg/L rhein effectively inhibited cytopathic effects (CPE) in EPC induced by LMBRaV, resulting in a 97 % reduction in viral replication rates. Furthermore, a six-point dose-response experiment revealed that rhein doses as low as 6.4 mg/L inhibited LMBRaV and suppressed LMBRaV infection with a dose-dependent manner. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that sustained rhein activity effectively alleviated CPE and nuclear damage caused by LMBRaV infection. Additionally, rhein exerted protective effects against declines in LMBRaV-induced mitochondrial membrane potential. In vivo experiments validated that largemouth bass diets supplemented with 0.075 % rhein exerted a protective effect against LMBRaV infection. Moreover, LMBRaV MCP gene expression levels were lower in several organs of fish in the rhein supplementation group. Immunogene analysis determined that rhein upregulated relevant gene expression levels in multiple organs of largemouth bass, with higher activities observed for the Mx, INF-γ, and IRF3 genes. Histopathological results displayed that a supplemental dosage of 0.075 % rhein significantly mitigated LMBRaV infection-induced pathological damage in the liver, spleen, and kidney. Taken together, these in vivo and in vitro results support the effective use of rhein as a promising candidate for the development of antiviral treatment against LMBRaV infection, highlighting its role in aquatic animal husbandry as a wide-spectrum antiviral and immune response booster.

AB  - In recent years, the pace of novel antibiotic development has been relatively slow, intensifying the urgency of the antibiotic resistance issue. Consequently, scientists have turned their attention to enhancing antibiotic activity by coordinating antibiotics with metal elements. This study designs and synthesizes three novel antibacterial copper complexes based on Gatifloxacin. These complexes exhibit potent antibacterial activity, notably Cu-1, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of only 0.063 μg/mL against Staphylococcus aureus (S.aureus), demonstrating potent bacteriostatic capabilities. Further investigations unveil the antibacterial mechanisms of complex Cu-1, revealing its ability not only to suppress the activities of DNA gyrase and topoisomerases IV, but also to effectively inhibit biofilm formation and disrupt the integrity of cell membrane. This multi-targeting action contributes to mitigating the risk of bacterial resistance emergence. Additionally, synergy between Cu-1 and conventional antibiotics is confirmed through checkerboard assays, offering novel strategies for antibacterial therapy. In vivo experiments using a murine model of S.aureus infection demonstrate the significant antibacterial efficacy of Cu-1, providing robust support for its potential in treating S.aureus infections. This study demonstrates that the coordination complexes formed by copper, Gatifloxacin and suitable aromatic heterocyclic ligands exhibit multi-targeting characteristics against bacteria, offering a new direction for combating antibiotic resistance in antibacterial therapy.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered an attractive generation of novel antibiotics due to their advantageous properties such as a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against pathogens, low cytotoxicity, and drug resistance. Although they have common structural features and it has been widely demonstrated that bacterial membranes represent the main target of the peptide activity, the exact mechanism underlying the membrane perturbation by AMPs is not fully understood. Nevertheless, all the proposed modes of action implicate the preliminary interaction of AMPs with the negatively charged lipids in bacterial membranes. Recently, the structural and functional characterization of two AMPs, RiLK1 and RiLK3, was reported. Specifically, both peptides were revealed to be multitalented compounds capable of binding Gram-positive and Gram-negative liposome models with high affinity, but their mechanism of action remains elusive. In this paper, the effects of RiLK1 and RiLK3 on vesicles mimicking prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell membranes were further examined by using different approaches. Fluorescence and quenching assays either by acrylamide or lipophilic probes suggested that the peptides were mainly located at the interface of the negatively charged membranes that mimicked those of Salmonella Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus, possibly oriented in a parallel manner. Furthermore, RiLK1 and RiLK3 caused a significant leakage of carboxyfluorescein from bacterial liposomes, demonstrating that they can permeabilize the target membranes at high doses. Conversely, both peptides appear to behave like cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) at concentrations near their MIC values evaluated against the bacterial targets. Moreover, Dynamic Light Scattering provided further insights on the mechanisms of antimicrobial peptide against the bacterial liposomes. Conclusively, in vitro experiments indicated that RiLK1 and RiLK3 displayed potent bacteriostatic efficacy at low micromolar concentrations against an antibiotic-resistant ESKAPE pathogen, making them a valuable tool in preventing and treating infections caused by such bacteria.

AB  - PURPOSE: To define the optimal fosfomycin dosing regimens for drug-resistant gram-negative bacteria in critically ill patients and those receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) via Monte Carlo simulations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A pharmacokinetic model for patients with and without CRRT was created to predict fosfomycin deposition in these patients. The pharmacodynamics (PD) targets were AUC/MIC ratio > 21.5, 28.2, and 98.8 for drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and Escherichia coli (EC) infections, respectively. The optimal regimen was defined when the probability of target attainment (PTA) was >90 % of the virtual patients. RESULTS: The fosfomycin dosing regimens for KP infections with MIC 64 mg/L in critically ill patients and who received CRRT were 6 g every 8 h and 8 g every 12 h, respectively. For PA infections, the regimens of 6 g every 6 h and 7 g every 8 h achieved the target in critically ill patients and those undergoing CRRT. No regimen achieved the 90 % PTA against the EC infection with MIC >32 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: Dosing regimens for bacteria with high MICs as 64 mg/L in these patients were 18-24 g/day. Dose adjustments were required in those undergoing CRRT. Clinical validation is strongly needed.

AB  - Sewage sludge is a critical reservoir for biological pollutants, and its harmless disposal remains a major issue. Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) as typical household disinfectants are inevitably concentrated in sewage sludge, and have the potential to affect human pathogenic bacteria (HPBs) that remain poorly understood. This study found that the relative abundance of HPBs in digesters was decreased by 10 - 20 % at low QACs dose, but increased by 238 - 591 % at high QACs dose. Mechanistic analysis revealed that low QACs doses promoted functional hydrolytic/fermentative bacteria and their metabolism by stimulating extracellular polymeric substances secretion and enhancing resistance to QACs. Conversely, high QAC doses decreased microbial biomass and developed QACs and antibiotic resistance of HPBs by increasing cell membrane permeability and triggering oxidative stress, resulting in deteriorating sanitation performance. These findings provide advanced insights into the potential function and hazards of exogenous QACs on the biosafety of digestate.

AB  - Plants are the major source of natural flavour ingredients reported for their wide applications in food and pharmaceuticals, oral care and wellness products, etc. We have investigated the water-soluble fractions (WSF) of basil tetraploid (O. basilicum L.) for their toxicity and biological potential against Salmonella Typhimurium, a pathogen causing around one million cases of illnesses in the United States every year. The WSF obtained using a Clevenger-type apparatus was further divided into two equal parts, one each for in-vivo toxicity evaluation and quality assessments, respectively. The proportions of major phenylpropanoid identified as meta-eugenol in the WSF were found in the range of 42.8-57.9 %, which was substantially in higher proportion as compared to essential oil (20.9-23.0 %). Based on sub-acute oral toxicity data, WSF has not shown any adverse effect with levels as high as 500 μL/25 g body weight in Swiss albino mice. Besides, the WSF also exhibited a maximum reduction in bacterial load in mice infected with Salmonella Typhimurium in a dose-dependent manner. We have shown the biological potential of basil water-soluble fraction as an effective bacterial load-suppressing agent for the prevention of Salmonella infections in animal model.

AB  - Oxysterols (OSs) represent a large family of cholesterol-derived molecules, involved in several physiological and pathological processes. Recently, we reported the remarkable antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) infection of three cholenamide or homocholenamide derivatives, namely PFM067, PFM064, and PFM069, identified by the screening of an in-house library of OS derivatives. With the aim to shed light on the antiviral mechanism of action of this class of molecules, we assumed to exploit the use of cholenamide-based fluorescent probes. Herein, we report that PFM120 and PFM124, two fluorescent tagged version of PFM067 maintain the same antiviral properties against HSV-2 as the parent compound and localize intracellularly inside the endoplasmic reticulum and the cis-Golgi network. Moreover, we also demonstrate that both tagged molecules co-localize with oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) and are able to induce its re-localization. Finally, we report that PFM120 and PFM124 are endowed with antiviral activity against another OSBP-dependent viral pathogen, i.e. the human rhinovirus (HRV), different in structure and replication strategy from HSV-2. Taken together, these results candidate PFM120 and PFM124 as useful tools to investigate the actual mechanism of action and molecular target(s) of cholenamide-based antivirals and provide a proof of principle to explore them as a promising broad-spectrum class of antiviral agents.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a formidable global health challenge. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacterial infections are of primary concern due to diminishing treatment options and high morbidity and mortality. Colistin, a polymyxin family antibiotic, is a last-resort treatment for MDR Gram-negative infections, but its wider use has resulted in escalating resistance. In 2022, using a screening approach, we discovered that a [1,2,5]oxadiazolo[3,4-b]pyrazine (ODP)-containing compound selectively re-sensitized various MDR Gram-negative bacteria to colistin. Initial structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies confirmed that bisanilino ODP compounds are colistin adjuvants with low mammalian toxicity. Herein, we report our extended SAR studies on a wide range of ODP analogs bearing alkyl- or arylalkylamines. Specifically, we discovered two new compounds, 5q and 8g, with potent colistin-potentiating activity and low mammalian toxicity in a wide range of clinically relevant pathogens.

AB  - Fifteen undescribed phenylpropanoyl phloroglucinol derivatives featuring modified isoprenyl and/or geranyl units (1-15), in conjunction with thirteen known analogues (16-28), were obtained from the glandular hairs of the fruit of Mallotus philippensis. Meanwhile, fourteen pairs of new enantiomers [(±)-1-9, (±)-11-15] were further resolved by chiral purification. Their structures were determined by comprehensive spectroscopic analyses, single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments and quantum chemical calculations. Bioactivity evaluation showed that compound 17 exhibited significant anti-bacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with MIC of 6 μg/mL, while compounds 3, 4, 8 and 18 displayed moderate effects with MIC of 24, 12, 24, and 12 μg/mL, respectively. The KEGG enrichment analysis of 17 revealed that the phosphotransferase system (PTS) pathway was significantly enriched. In addition, compound 17 was found to affect the amino acids biosynthesis and amino acids/carbohydrate metabolism, and the qRT-PCR verified the accuracy of the transcriptome analysis.

AB  - An exploration of antibacterial components from the whole plant of Euphorbia humifusa led to the isolation of 14 new triterpenoids, euphohumifusoids A-N (1-7 and 9-15), as well as four known analogues (8 and 16-18). Their structures were elucidated by extensively analysis of the spectroscopic data and X-ray crystallography using Cu Kα radiation. Among them, euphohumifusoid A (1) bears an unique 6(7 → 8)abeo scaffold originated from a D:C-friedo-oleanane skeleton for the first time, euphohumifusoids H and I (9 and 10) possess a rare α,β-unsaturated-γ-lactone chain originated from 25,26,27-trinordammaranes, and euphohumifusoid L (13) is a highly modified 3,4-seco-25,26,27-trinorcycloartane. Notably, in antibacterial bioassay, compound 1 displayed excellent antibacterial activities against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and S.epidermidis with MIC of 12.5, 25, and 25 μg/mL, comparable to the positive controls. Upon exposure to 1 and 2 MIC of 1, B.cereus underwent drastic morphological changes, resulting in complete disruption of the cells. Meanwhile, compound 1 also exhibited remarkable antibiofilm activity against B.cereus at 1 MIC and 2 MIC.

AB  - Inspired by the fact that the introduction of indole pharmacophore in organic scaffolds could enable interesting pharmacological properties, the series of novel tryptamine-derived Schiff bases was synthetized. Tryptamine was used as a source of indole pattern, as well as an example of biogenic amines which chemical transformations lead to the compounds with prominent biological activities. The obtained results for antimicrobial activity against a range of bacterial and fungal strains and cytotoxic activities have revealed that Schiff base TSB4 combining the tryptamine and p-nitro aryl patterns in the structure showed better antifungal activity at low concentrations than standard drug Fluconazole, while compound TSB6 with molecular scaffold composed from tryptamine and quinoline moieties showed certain cytotoxic effect on HCT-116 cell line with a strongly expressed selectivity about healthy fibroblast cells, MRC-5. For these two selected compounds, additional ADME analysis and DNA interactions were performed. to obtain better insight into their pharmacokinetics and determination of binding mode for DNA molecules. As results suggested, strong binding of examined compounds to CT-DNA was observed, while the ADME screening showed that selected compounds possess suitable physicochemical properties for oral bioavailability and druglikeness.

AB  - Developing pure diastereoisomeric molecular hybrids for the selective inhibition of bacterial growth opened new avenues for combating the ever-increasing microbial resistance. Considering this, a series of diastereoisomeric pure pyrazolyl-dihydrofurans (7a-7y) were synthesized and characterized using NMR, LCMS, and X-ray crystallography. DFT based method was used to explore the configurational stability of cis over trans isomeric form. Considering 7a and 8a as representative isomeric forms with same structural framework, the difference in their bio-efficacy against bacterial and fungal strains was assessed using serial dilution method. The relatively high inhibition of bacterial growth by the cis isomeric form (7a) (MIC = 1.562 µg/mL), amoxicillin (MIC = 3.125 µg/mL) inspired us to broaden the substrate scope for synthesizing a series of pure diastereoisomeric cis forms as selective anti-bacterial agents. However, both the isomers displayed antifungal activity less than the standard drug (Fluconazole) employed in the study. All the reactions proceeded smoothly and yielded a diverse array of dihydrofuran derivatives. The developed synthetics were found to be non-cytotoxic against mouse fibroblast cells and didn't affect the seed germination of Brassica nigra seeds when treated at 1 mg/mL concentration. The experimentally determined in vitro results were further validated using in silico molecular docking and dynamics studies.

AB  - Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) have been essential for protecting human health for almost a century, functioning as surface disinfectants and sanitizers. With bacterial resistance increasing against commercially available QACs, the development of novel antimicrobials with divergent architectures is essential for effective infection prevention and control. Toward this end, our group has expanded beyond traditional ammonium scaffolds and explored the development of quaternary phosphonium compounds (QPCs). Herein, we report the synthesis and biological investigation of a series of 20 novel multicationic QPCs, bearing multiple short alkyl or aryl chains, also referred to as "bushy-tailed" multiQPCs; these structures were hypothesized to have strong bioactivity while displaying low mammalian toxicity. Select bushy-tailed QPC derivatives with trishexylphosphonium groups displayed single-digit or sub-micromolar activity against all seven bacteria tested, and MIC values of 2- to 8-fold better than their bushy-tailed QAC counterparts. Importantly, therapeutic indices of these bushy-tailed QPCs were favorable in many cases, and were ≥4 against the entire bacterial panel for pX-P6*,P6* and 1,8-P6*,P6*, superior to more traditional architectures. This work highlights the promise of a novel set of multicationic phosphonium compounds as novel disinfectants with potent bioactivities and low toxicity.

The cobalt and nickel transporter (Cnt) system synthesizes and transports staphylopine, a nicotianamine-like metallophore, and serves as a primary transition metal uptake system in Gram-positive bacteria including the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. In this study, we report the design of the first inhibitor of the Cnt system by targeting the key aminobutanoyltransferase CntL which is involved in the biosynthesis of staphylopine. Through structure-guided fragment linking and optimization, a class of acceptor-adenosine dual-site inhibitors against S. aureus CntL (SaCntL) were designed and synthesized.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of Macleaya cordata extract (MCE) on the performance, gut health, and microbiota of laying hens. A total of 192 thirty-wk-old Hyline brown laying hens were randomly divided into 4 treatment groups. The CON group received a basal diet, while the low (MCE250), medium (MCE350), and high (MCE450) dose groups were supplemented with 250, 350, and 450 mg/kg MCE, respectively. The egg weight and Haugh unit demonstrated a linear and quadratic increase with the MCE dose during the initial 4-wk period of the experiment (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the dietary supplementation of MCE led to a significant enhancement in eggshell thickness and Haugh unit at wk 8 and the data showed a statistically significant linear and quadratic increase (P < 0.05). Serum cytokine assay showed that dietary supplementation of MCE led to linear and quadratic increases in IL-4 and IL-10 level (P < 0.05). Dietary supplementation of 350 and 450 mg/kg MCE was observed to result in linear and quadratic increase in serum lysozyme levels (P < 0.05). The addition of MCE to the diet resulted in a linear and quadratic increase in the levels of sIgA in the jejunum and ileum (P < 0.05). In terms of gene expression, the addition of MCE to the diet resulted in linear and quadratic increases in the expression of IL-10, IgA, Serpinb14, Serpinb14B, and OIH (P < 0.05). The expression of jejunal genes pIgR and IL-4 was observed to increase in a linear and quadratic manner, respectively, following the dietary addition of 350 mg/kg MCE and IL-1β decreased in a linear manner (P < 0.05). Moreover, these favorable effects were maximized at medium dosage (350 mg/kg) of MCE addition, and intestinal microbial composition in the control and MCE350 groups was assessed. 350 mg/kg MCE increased the relative abundance of Bryobacter and Parasutterella and decreased the relative abundance of Erysipelatoclostridium in the cecum (P < 0.05). Spearman correlation analysis revealed that Bryobacter, Parasutterella, Skermanella, and Erysipelatoclostridium were associated with nonspecific immune functions (P < 0.05). In conclusion, 350 mg/kg MCE supplementation elevated the immune response, and upregulated the expression of genes related to protein production in eggs, thereby improving egg quality. These effects may be associated with changes in the microbiota, specifically Bryobacter, Parasutterella, and Erysipelatoclostridium.

AB  - The development of effective treatments for dental pathogens and oral cancer remains a significant challenge. Copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) are recognized for their strong antimicrobial properties, attributed to the synthesis of oxygen-dependent radicals. α-Mangostin (MG), a natural xanthone from mangosteen fruit, is well-known for its antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anticancer potential. The combination of CuO NPs with MG would offer a synergistic approach to enhance therapeutic efficacy. CuO-MG NPs were synthesized and characterized for their size, morphology, and surface properties. The antimicrobial efficacy of these nanoparticles was tested against oral pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, and Candida albicans. Antioxidant activity was assessed using superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical anion. The anticancer potential was evaluated by examining apoptosis induction in oral cancer cell lines, focusing on the expression of key apoptotic markers such as Caspase-3, Caspase-8, and FasL. Molecular docking simulations were performed to understand the interaction between MG and biofilm receptors. The CuO-MG NPs evidenced significant antimicrobial efficacy against all tested oral pathogens, with enhanced efficacy attributed to the combined effects of CuO-induced oxidative stress and the antimicrobial properties of MG. Antioxidant assays demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in radical scavenging activity. In oral cancer cells, CuO-MG NPs significantly reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis, as evidenced by the up-regulation of Caspase-3, Caspase-8, and FasL. Molecular docking studies revealed strong binding affinities of MG to key biofilm receptors, disrupting pathogen adhesion and biofilm formation. The combination of CuO NPs and MG offers a powerful and multifaceted therapeutic approach to oral healthcare. CuO-MG NPs demonstrate synergistic antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer properties, offering a potential approach for the management of oral infections and oral cancer. Further preclinical and clinical studies are recommended to ensure their safety and stability in medical applications.

AB  - The striking rise of infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens has evolved as a serious threat to public health worldwide. To develop new antibacterials to combat multidrug-resistant bacteria, a novel class of amphiphilic chalcone derivatives serving as antimicrobial peptidomimetics was designed and synthesized. Among them, the most promising compound 14b displayed broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive bacteria (MICs = 0.5-1 μg/mL) and Gram-negative bacteria (MICs = 1-32 μg/mL), low hemolytic activity, and good membrane selectivity. Moreover, compound 14b exhibited rapid bactericidal action, a low probability of developing resistance, high proteolytic stability, and strong capabilities of inhibiting and destroying bacterial biofilms. Further mechanism investigations revealed that compound 14b possessed strong membrane-disrupting abilities and could disintegrate the integrity of bacterial cell membranes by destroying transmembrane potential and enhancing membrane permeability, and causing the generation of intracellular ROS and the leakage of DNA and proteins, ultimately leading to bacterial death. More importantly, compound 14b also showed excellent in vivo therapeutic potency in a mouse septicemia model infected by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, indicating its potential to be an antibacterial agent to confront bacterial infections.

AB  - The prelaying period is critical for laying hens, marked by significant physiological changes such as increased egg production, hormone secretion, and higher nutritional demands. These changes stress the intestine, which is vital for nutrient digestion, absorption, immune defense, and maintaining antioxidant and microbial balance. During this period, maintaining the intestinal health is essential for efficient nutrient absorption. Curcumin, a plant-derived extract, offers antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory benefits, that can improve gut function. This study evaluated the effects of curcumin on the intestinal structure, immune barrier function, and cecal microbiota composition in laying hens during their early laying period. A total of 180 Snowy White chickens (154 days old) were divided into 5 experimental groups, receiving curcumin at 0 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, 300 mg/kg, and 400 mg/kg for 12 wk. The results showed that curcumin significantly improved the intestinal morphology (P < 0.05), increased mRNA expression of digestive enzymes (such as MGAM, SI, and ANPEP), and enhanced the digestive and absorptive functions. Further, curcumin improved the levels of antioxidant parameters (such as CAT, GSH-PX, T-AOC, and T-SOD) in the ileum, jejunum, and duodenum, and increased the expression of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG) in the intestinal segments and serum (P < 0.05). Curcumin also improved the intestinal immune barrier function by increasing ZO-1 and Occludin expression. Furthermore, it altered the gut microbiota composition by increasing the relative abundance of beneficial bacterial phyla such as Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Fusobacteria (P < 0.05). At the genus level, curcumin supplementation enhanced the beneficial genera like Phocaeicola, Alistipes, Prevotella, Barnesiella, and Bifidobacterium (P < 0.05), thereby promoting the gut health and microbial diversity. In conclusion, curcumin supplementation during the early laying period of hens offers significant benefits by improving the intestinal health, immune function, and gut microbiota composition. Hence, curcumin serves as a promising dietary additive to support nutrient absorption and immune defense in laying hens during the early laying period of hens.

AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans as the critical priority fungal pathogens for which therapeutic solutions are needed. Azole-based antifungal agents, including triazoles, diazoles, and thiazoles, are widely used in the treatments for fungal infections. In light of past successes in the transformation of antibacterial kanamycin into antifungal derivatives via chemical modifications, a new library of kanamycin-azole hybrids was synthesized and tested against a panel of azole-resistant and susceptible Candida and Cryptococcus strains. Structure activity relationship (SAR) studies revealed pivotal roles for antifungal activity of the azole ring (imidazole vs triazole) and halogen substituents on the benzene ring (F vs Cl). Most notably, hybrids 13, 14 and 15 were active against resistant C. albicans, C. tropicalis and C. neoformans strains and non-toxic towards mammalian cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Wastewater Based Surveillance (WBS) has emerged as a novel monitoring tool for tracking and estimating the dissemination of the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) within communities. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this review is to assess the factors that influence estimations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration estimations in wastewater. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) criteria in the electronic databases Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Medline. The overall quality, sample methodologies, quantification methods, and estimating approaches of selected papers were assessed. RESULTS: Our findings reveal that 16 out of 24 articles (67 %) focused on physiochemical analyses. This review showed that sampling strategies and laboratory methodologies play a crucial role in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater samples. Moreover, we found that WBS-based estimation of COVID-19 is influenced by several factors such as wastewater temperature, shedding rate, and population size. CONCLUSION: This review reveals that the identified parameters require adjustments to achieve optimum conditions that accurately predict community infections. Including these factors that influence the estimation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in wastewater is essential for developing effective public health strategies to combat the spread of COVID-19.

AB  - Nine undescibed abietane diterpenoid alkaloids (DAs), salviamines G‒H (1-2), isosalviamines G‒J (3-6), and miltiorramines A‒C (7-9) were isolated from the roots of Salvia miltiorrhiza. Their chemical structures including absolute configurations were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis (including 1D and 2D NMR, and HRESIMS), combined with the calculated ECD method and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Among them, compounds 1-6 are unusual 20-nor- or 19,20-bisnor-abietane DAs with an oxazole ring. Compounds 7-8 are the first examples of DAs with a nitro group isolated from plant sources. Notably, compound 9 possesses a rare hexahydropyrrolo[2,1-b]oxazole unit that is fused in the ring B of the abietane skeleton. Bioactivity assay indicated that compound 3 showed significant anti-inflammatory activity by decreasing the gene expressions of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bioengineered artificial skin substitutes (BASS) are an advanced therapy for treating extensively burned patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) infections represent a major challenge in these patients as formation of biofilms impede wound healing and perpetuate a chronic inflammatory state. Here we assessed antibiotics (alone or in combination) with respect to cytotoxicity, as well as antimicrobial efficacy in P. aeruginosa biofilm formed on infection of BASS. METHODS: Cell viability, structure and functionality were evaluated using microscopy and trans-epidermal water loss analyses, respectively. BASS were established and infected for 24 h to allow P. aeruginosa biofilm formation, after which two antimicrobial approaches, treatment and prevention, were tested. In the latter, antibiotics were added to BASS before infection. The antimicrobial effect was determined using real-time calorimetry. RESULTS: In dose-response experiments, 1.25 mg/mL amikacin, 0.02 mg/mL ciprofloxacin, 0.051 mg/mL colistin, 1 mg/mL meropenem and colistin in combination with either amikacin, ciprofloxacin and meropenem did not affect BASS' viability, structure and functionality. All antibiotics, except colistin, showed effective antimicrobial activity at these non-cytotoxic concentrations. For concentrations below the highest non-cytotoxic ones, successive treatments resulted in higher bacterial metabolic rates. Only the combinations managed to eradicate the infection with repeated treatments. With respect to prevention of infection, all antibiotics at the highest non-cytotoxic concentrations and the combinations were effective. This preventive capacity was maintained for at least 5 days. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight the potential for developing BASS with antimicrobial properties that can prevent infections during wound healing in burn patients.

AB  - The widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, the growing number of immunocompromised individuals, and the emergence of drug-resistant strains have resulted in the increasing incidence and mortality of invasive fungal infections. Azole drugs are the primary treatment for invasive fungal infections, and Iodiconazole is a potent azole drug with strong antifungal activity, but its stability is poor. In order to improve stability, a series of triazole compounds containing ethynyl group were designed and synthesized. Most of the compounds showed strong inhibitory activity against pathogenic fungi, among which compound 20l showed excellent inhibitory activity against pathogenic fungi and drug-resistant fungi. Importantly, and the stability of 20l (T

AB  - There is growing interest in developing monotherapy drugs that treat inflammation caused by microbial infections, focusing on dual antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agents with minimal side effects and high safety margins. This study synthesized and characterized a library of novel cis-4-ferrocenylazetidin-2-ones, evaluating their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities. These organometallic monocyclic β-lactams showed moderate in vitro antimicrobial activity against various standard microbial strains, including yeasts and Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Some compounds overcame the resistance of clinical Staphylococcus aureus isolates. Traditionally, monocyclic β-lactams target Gram-negative bacilli, but adding a ferrocene moiety and substituting the COOH group near the N-1 position with a non-ionizable ester group (COOR) extended their activity spectrum. The anti-inflammatory properties were assessed in macrophage-based models, revealing non-cytotoxicity below 10 μM. Two compounds were shown to be strong and selective arginase inhibitors, while five others effectively suppressed excessive NO formation without affecting basal NO production. The presence of a phenoxy group at C-3 of the β-lactam ring appeared to be crucial for selective NO inhibition. These hybrids did not scavenge NO but inhibited NO synthesis by suppressing iNOS expression. Overall, two novel hybrids were identified as promising hit candidates for treating infection-induced inflammatory reactions.

AB  - Pentachlorophenol (PCP), a ubiquitous environmental pollutant, has been reported as a possible contributor to diabetes. However, evidence for general population is scarce while related mechanisms are largely unknown. Using a representative population-based case-control study in Beijing (n = 1796), we found a positive association between PCP exposure and diabetes risk with the odds ratio reaching 1.68 (95 % confidence interval: 1.30 to 2.18). A further rat experiment revealed that low-dose PCP mimicking real-world human exposure can significantly impair glycemic homeostasis by inducing pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, with non-linear dose-response relationships. Subsequent multi-omics analysis suggested that low-dose PCP led to notable gut microbiota dysbiosis (especially the species from genus Prevotella, such as intermedia, dentalis, ruminicola, denticola, melaninogenica, and oris), decreased serum amino acids (L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine, and L-tryptophan) and increased serum fatty acids (oleic and palmitic acid) in rats, while strong correlations were observed among alterations of gut microbes, serum metabolites and glycemic-related biomarkers (e.g., fasting blood glucose and insulin). Collectively, these results imply PCP may increase diabetes risk by disrupting gut microbial-related amino acids and fatty acids biosynthesis. This will help guide future in-depth studies on the roles of PCP in the development of human diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Using ecological momentary assessment (EMA), we undertook a natural experiment wherein kratom-product variability was a tool to assess kratom dose-response relationships based on product form and alkaloid level. METHODS: Between July-November 2022, 357 US kratom consumers (56.6 % male, 90.2 % non-Hispanic white) completed 15 days of EMA; 348 participants submitted samples of the products used most often during EMA. These were assayed for ten alkaloids using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Self-reported kratom effects were modeled as a function of kratom amount and alkaloid content. RESULTS: Participants used over 220 brands. The most-reported product forms were loose powder (55.8 %) and encapsulated powder (26.8 %); extracts were used less (419 uses across 9.48 % of participants). Of the 12,244 use-event entries, 7726 had follow-up data (15-180minutes after use) on felt effects. Effects were stronger in participants with a higher average amount per use. Within-person dose-response relationships were obscured by highly-consistent within-person dosages. Effects of loose powder decreased over three hours; effects of extracts started higher but decreased more rapidly. Dose-response relationships for specific alkaloids could not be reliably established because total alkaloid content and relative levels of specific alkaloids showed limited variability between products. Higher levels of corynoxine alkaloids were associated with slightly stronger effects, possibly an artifact of modeling data with low alkaloid variability. CONCLUSIONS: Alkaloid content was surprisingly consistent across kratom products, and participants were consistent in the amount they used across events. Firm conclusions about alkaloid-effect relationships for kratom will require experimenter-controlled manipulations of agent and dose.

AB  - With the advent of antibiotic resistant organisms, development of alternate classes of molecules other than antibiotics to combat microbial infections, have become extremely important. In this context, antimicrobial peptides have taken center stage of antimicrobial therapeutic research. In this work, we have reported two cationic antimicrobial octapeptides WRL and LWRF, with broad spectrum antimicrobial activities against several strains of ESKAPE pathogens. Both the peptides were membrane associative and induced microbial cell death through membranolysis, being selective towards microbial membranes over mammalian membranes. The AMPs were unstructured in water, adopting partial helical conformation in the presence of microbial membrane mimics. Electrostatic interaction formed the primary basis of peptide-membrane interactions. WRL was more potent, salt tolerant and faster acting of the two AMPs, owing to the presence of two tryptophan residues against that of one in LWRF. Increased tryptophan number in WRL enhanced its membrane association ability, resulting in higher antimicrobial potency but lower selectivity. This experimental and computational work, established that an optimum number of tryptophan residues and their position was critical for obtaining high antimicrobial potency and selectivity simultaneously in the designed cationic AMPs. Understanding the peptide membrane interactions in atomistic details can lead to development of better antimicrobial therapeutics in future.

This study aims to investigate the antiviral activity of BBR against rotavirus and evaluate its cytotoxicity and pharmacological efficacies, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities in vitro. Using ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, the saturation concentration of BBR was determined as 2261 μg/mL, indicating that BBR is a poor water-soluble compound. The inhibition rate of nitric oxide (NO) production of BBR solution at a concentration of 283 μg/mL was similar to that of Cardamonin 0.3 μM with a cell viability of 92.46±0.35 %, revealing the anti-inflammatory activity of BBR.

AB  - A diverse set of 4,7-dihydro-[1,2,3]thiadiazolo[5,4-b]pyridine-6-carboxamides 4(a-o) was synthesized via a one-pot reaction of 5-amino-[1,2,3]thiadiazole, various aromatic aldehydes, and different acetoacetanilides, using glacial acetic acid. The resulting compounds were obtained in moderate to good yields. All the newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity. Among them, compound 4 e demonstrated superior efficacy against the Salinivibrio proteolyticus strain of Gram-negative bacteria compared to ciprofloxacin. Compound 4 d exhibited the highest potency against the fungal strain Candida albicans, surpassing amphotericin B. The physicochemical characteristics of 4 d and 4 e were assessed. According to docking analysis, DHTDAPy 4 e shows a higher binding affinity of -7.2 kcal/mol in the binding cavity of the receptor. These findings illustrate the safety, tolerability, and potency of the newly synthesized DHTDAPy compounds against fungal and bacterial infections.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tigecycline is considered one of the last resorts for treating infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is widely used in critically ill patients, especially those with acute kidney injury or severe infections. However, pharmacokinetic data for tigecycline in patients receiving CRRT are limited. METHODS: This was a single-center prospective clinical study with intensive sampling that included critically ill patients who received tigecycline and CRRT. A population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model was developed and evaluated by goodness-of-fit plots, bootstrap analysis, visual predictive checks, and numerical predictive checks. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target attainment and cumulative fraction of response analyses were performed to explore the potential need for dose adjustments of tigecycline in CRRT. RESULTS: In total, 21 patients with 167 concentrations were included. A two-compartment model adequately described the tigecycline concentration-time points, but no covariates were found to adequately explain the viability in the pharmacokinetic parameters of tigecycline. The typical values of CL, Q, V1 and V2 were 4.42 L/h, 34.8 L/h, 30.9 L and 98.7 L, respectively. For most infections, the standard regimen of 50 mg/12 h was deemed appropriate, expect for skin and soft skin tissue infections and community-acquired pneumonia caused by  CONCLUSION: A tigecycline PPK model describing critically ill patients undergoing CRRT was successfully developed. The optimized dosage regimens for various infections are recommended.

AB  - In a 21-d study, 480 Cobb 500 (off-sex) male broiler chicks were used to investigate the effects of feeding different sources and levels of resistant starches (RS) on growth performance, nutrient and energy utilization, and intestinal health in broiler chickens. The birds were allocated to 10 dietary treatments in a 3 × 3 + 1 factorial arrangement. The factors were 3 RS-sources (RSS): banana starch (BS), raw potato starch (RPS), and high-amylose corn starch (HCS); each at 3 levels (RSL) 25, 50, or 100 g/kg plus a corn-soybean meal control diet. Birds and feed were weighed on d 0, 8, and 21. On d 21, samples of jejunal tissue and digesta were collected for chemical analysis. Data were analyzed using the mixed model procedure of JMP with factor levels nested with the control. In the 0 to 21 phase, the birds fed the RPS diets had higher (P = 0.011) FI than those fed HCS or control diets, and FCR was greater (P = 0.030) in birds that received BS diets than in other diets. RSS × RSL was significant (P < 0.05) for total tract nutrient retention, AME, and AMEn on d 21. The starch digestibility was higher (P < 0.001) in birds that received the control diet than in RS diets, and decreased as RS levels increased, except for HCS. The apparent metabolizable energy (AME) and nitrogen-corrected AME (AMEn) were higher (P < 0.001) in birds fed 100 g/kg HCS diet, with both decreasing with increasing levels of BS and RPS, except for HCS. Relative ileal oligosaccharides profile showed significant (P < 0.05) RSS × RSL with a higher relative abundance of Hex(3) (P = 0.01) and Pent(3) (P = 0.001) in HCS diets. In conclusion, RS may influence gut health and growth performance in broiler chickens through modulation of cecal SCFA and nutrient digestion, but these depend largely on the botanical origin and concentrations of individual RS.

AB  - Mixed infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria and fungi pose a severe threat to human health, and multi-target drugs may provide an effective approach to combat drug-resistant pathogens. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the efficacies of some oleanolic acid (OA) derivatives against multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria and fungi using in vitro and in vivo experiments. Novel amphiphilic OA derivatives were designed and optimised, in which compounds G1 and J1 exhibited effective antimicrobial activity (MICs = 1-2 μg/mL), high selectivity against MDR strains, rapid bactericidal activity, and good predictive pharmacokinetics. Mechanistically, both compounds prevented drug resistance by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane, inserting into the DNA, and binding to DNA gyrase. Additionally, J1 reduced microbial count in a mouse MRSA skin infection model and accelerated wound healing much better than vancomycin. Conclusively, this study presents a new class of potential drugs for resistant bacteria and fungi.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Polymyxins are the last-line therapy for top-priority multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative bacteria. However, polymyxin nephrotoxicity impedes its clinical application. This study aimed to design, synthesize, and identify a novel and promising polymyxin derivative with high efficacy and low toxicity. METHODS: To design polymyxin derivatives, we reduced the hydrophobicity of the two hydrophobic domains (fatty acyl chain and D-Phe RESULTS: This research found a new compound, identified as compound 12, which showed similar or increased antibacterial activity against all tested sensitive and carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria. It exhibited reduced renal cytotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, and maintained or improved antibacterial efficacy in vivo. Importantly, its anti-Pseudomonas aeruginosa activity significantly improved. Compound 12, when combined with rifampicin, enhanced the activity of rifampin against gram-negative bacteria. Compound 12 also showed a high affinity for lipopolysaccharide and disrupted cell membrane integrity. CONCLUSION: Reducing the hydrophobicity of the two domains reduced renal cytotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Shortening the side chain of Dab

AB  - The use of wastewater for non-potable purposes is an important alternative for addressing water scarcity, especially in developing regions. However, minimizing the risks, particularly those associated with emerging contaminants that may induce resistance among pathogens in wastewater, is crucial. This study assessed the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in untreated wastewater used for agricultural purposes and evaluated the quantifiable health risks associated with this practice in Tamale, Ghana. The resistance of some Enterobacteriaceae, such as E. coli, Klebsiella, and Salmonella-Shigella, to four commonly used antibiotics in Ghana was assessed using a conventional microbiological culture approach and the Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method. A Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) was performed to estimate the health risks associated with two distinct scenarios of wastewater reuse: (1) accidental ingestion of contaminated wastewater and soil, and (2) consumption of vegetables irrigated with wastewater. This approach applied a Monte Carlo simulation based on 10,000 interactions and identified E. coli O157:H7 as the reference pathogen. Among Enterobacteriaceae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella-Shigella and E. coli were isolated, in concentrations exceeding the limit recommended by the World Health Organization (10

AB  - Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are emerging as a serious infectious disease worldwide. Due to the lack of effective antifungal drugs and serious drug resistance, the number of people with low immunity is increasing, leading to high morbidity and mortality. Azole drugs targeting CYP51 are widely used in the treatment of invasive fungal infections. By analyzing representative azole antifungal drugs, the characteristics of pharmacophore were summarized. The binding mode of lead compound Iodiconazole was analyzed, and it was found that the narrow hydrophobic cavity was not fully occupied. Therefore, a series of triazole compounds were designed and synthesized by fragment growth strategy. Most of the compounds showed strong inhibitory activity against pathogenic fungi, among which compound A33 showed excellent inhibitory activity against pathogenic fungi and drug-resistant strains. In addition, the preferred compound A33 can prevent fungal phase transition, the formation of fungal biofilm, and show satisfactory fungicidal activity. In addition, the compound A33 was almost non-toxic to mammalian HUVEC cell. These results strongly suggested that compound A33 was worth further investigation as a potential azole inhibitor.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance poses a significant threat to global health, necessitating the development of novel therapeutic agents with unique mechanisms of action. Inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), an essential enzyme in guanine nucleotide biosynthesis, is a promising target for the discovery of new antimicrobial agents. High-throughput screening studies have previously identified several urea-based leads as potential inhibitors, although many of these are characterised by reduced chemical stability. In this work, we describe the design and synthesis of a series of heteroaryl-susbtituted analogues and the evaluation of their inhibitory potency against IMPDHs. Our screening targets ESKAPEE pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Several analogues with submicromolar inhibitory potency are identified and show no inhibitory potency on human IMPDH nor cytotoxic effects on human cells. Kinetic studies revealed that these molecules act as noncompetitive inhibitors with respect to the substrates and ligand virtual docking simulations provided insights into the binding interactions at the interface of the NAD

AB  - Infectious aerosols are expired in various sizes, and the number of contained virions is expected to significantly vary among expired aerosols. To evaluate the effect of the number of contained virions on infection risk, multi-virion aerosols in expired air should be first quantified. In this study, we categorised expired aerosols into traditional aerosol size bins and aerosols containing different number of virions. We quantified the number of virions in aerosols of each size bin and estimated the size distribution of aerosols which contain a certain number of virions when the viral load is known. This analysis helped us to determine the relationship between multi-size aerosols and multi-virion aerosols. Our findings indicate that for long-range airborne transmission, the airborne transmission droplets derived from four COVID-19 outbreak venues contain at most one infectious virion, supporting the one-virion assumption for the considered viral load ranges. However, for short-range airborne transmission, the impact of multi-virion aerosols on infection risk must be considered. Our quantification of multi-virion aerosols for the first time lays the groundwork for incorporating the multi-virion assumption into infection risk assessments.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance has become a serious threat to public health, thus novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat drug-resistant bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The 1,4-dicarbonylthiosemicarbazide is an interesting chemotype that could exhibit antibacterial activity. However, the currently available compounds are not as potent as clinical antibiotics. Herein, we adopted the computer-aided drug design strategy, substructure search, to retrieve antibacterial 1,4-dicarbonylthiosemicarbazide derivatives, and identified compound B5 (Specs ID: AG-690/15432331) from the Specs chemical library that exhibited moderate activity (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC): 6.25 μg/mL) against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213. Based on that compound, we further designed and synthesized 45 derivatives, and evaluated their antibacterial activity. Eight derivatives were more potent than or equivalent to vancomycin (MIC: 1.56 μg/mL). We compared the three most potent ones for their cytotoxicity to HepG2 and HUVEC cells and selected compound 1b as our lead compound for comprehensive biological evaluation. As a result, compound 1b exhibited a bacteriostatic mode, and was active against a panel of Gram-positive bacteria strains, metabolically stable, and effective to protect the mice from MRSA infection. More importantly, we applied 2D similarity calculation and reverse docking to predict potential targets of compound 1b. Through experimental validation and molecular dynamics simulation, we were able to confirm that compound 1b inhibited Staphylococcus aureus DNA gyrase (IC

AB  - Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a rapidly increasing threat to human health. New strategies to combat resistant organisms are desperately needed. One potential avenue is targeting two-component systems, which are the main bacterial signal transduction pathways used to regulate development, metabolism, virulence, and antibiotic resistance. These systems consist of a homodimeric membrane-bound sensor histidine kinase, and a cognate effector, the response regulator. Histidine kinases play an essential role in the regulation of multiple virulence mechanisms including toxin production, immune evasion, and antibiotic resistance. Targeting virulence, as opposed to development of bactericidal compounds, could reduce evolutionary pressure for acquired resistance. Additionally, compounds targeting the highly conserved catalytic and adenosine triphosphate-binding (CA) domain have the potential to impair multiple two-component systems that regulate virulence in one or more pathogens. We conducted in vitro structure-activity relationship studies of 2-aminobenzothiazole-based inhibitors designed to target the CA domain. We found that these compounds, which inhibit the model histidine kinase, HK853 from Thermotoga maritima, have anti-virulence activities inPseudomonas aeruginosa, reducing motility phenotypes and toxin production associated with the pathogenic functions of this bacterium.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The concurrent presence of helminthiasis and bacterial diseases imposes a dual burden, worsening the challenges associated with each condition independently. This cohabitation intensifies the economic impact, creating a compounding effect on public health and economic well-being. METHODS: Phytochemical analysis of Cassia alata Extract (CAE) using infrared spectroscopy has revealed the presence of various functional groups. In addition, GC mass analysis has confirmed the presence of 26 active compounds. An assessment of the anthelmintic activity of CAE against mature earthworms has demonstrated comparable efficacy to the conventional anthelmintic, albendazole. The optimal dosage of 500 mg/ml has induced a rapid onset of paralysis (2.7 ± 0.5 min) and death (20.1 ± 1.7 min), outperforming albendazole (20 mg/mL) in terms of faster paralysis and death times (21.8 ± 1.1 and 30.14 ± 3.2 min, respectively). Structural modifications induced by CAE have been observed through light microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Control worms have exhibited normal body architecture, while CAE-treated worms have displayed size reduction, uniform body wall shrinkage, and increased cuticular thickness. Similar alterations have been observed in albendazole-treated worms. RESULTS: The antibacterial activity of CAE has been evaluated through a broth dilution assay, which has revealed a dose-response effect. At 6.25 mg/ml, CAE has exhibited 100% inhibitory action against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Significant differences in bacterial viability have been noted at lower concentrations, with no significant variation at 0.3906 mg/ml of CAE. CONCLUSION: The findings have highlighted the multifaceted bioactivity of CAE, showcasing its potential as an anthelmintic agent and antimicrobial agent against a spectrum of bacterial strains. The observed structural alterations in treated worms have provided insights into the potential mechanisms underlying the anthelmintic effects.

AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a deadly pathogen that claims millions of lives every year. Current research focuses on finding new anti-tuberculosis drugs that are safe and effective, with lesser side effects and toxicity. One important approach is to identify bio-enhancers that can improve the effectiveness of anti-tuberculosis drugs, resulting in reduced doses and shortened treatment times. The present study investigates the use of C-4 modified isotetrones as bio-enhancers. A series of studies suggest an isotetrone, labeled as C11, inhibits growth, improves MIC, MBC and enhances the killing of M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain when used in combination with the first line and injectable anti-TB drugs in a dose-dependent manner. The combination of C11 and rifampicin also reduces the generation of spontaneous mutants against rifampicin and reaches a mutation prevention concentration (MPC) with moderate rifampicin concentrations. The identified compounds are effective against the MDR strain of M. tuberculosis and non-cytotoxic in HepG2 cells. We find that C11 induces the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) inside macrophages and within bacteria, resulting in better efficacy.

AB  - The biosynthesis of nanoparticles is a crucial research area aimed at developing innovative, cost-effective, and eco-friendly synthesis techniques for various applications. Herein, we synthesized copper oxide nanoparticles (CuNPs) using Couroupita guianensis flower extract via a simple green synthesis method. These green CuNPs demonstrate promising antimicrobial activity and anticancer activity against A549 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. We comprehensively characterized the CuNPs using UV spectrum, XRD, FTIR, SEM, and EDS analyses. The antibacterial and anticancerous performance is attributed to their spherical-like morphology, which enhances effective interaction with bacterial and cancer cells. Moreover, CuNPs proved effective in inactivating Escherichia coli, achieving 2%, 52%, and 99% inactivation at 0, 30, and 60 min, respectively, and Listeria monocytogenes, achieving 1%, 48%, and 98% inactivation at 0, 30, and 60 min, respectively, under visible light. Furthermore, the CuNPs exhibited significant anticancer activity against A549 NSCLC cells, achieving cell viability reductions of 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 83%, and 91% at concentrations of 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 μg/mL, respectively. The green synthesized CuNPs demonstrate their potential in biomedical applications.

AB  - Listeria monocytogenes is the foodborne pathogen responsible for listeriosis in humans. Its ability to grow at refrigeration temperatures, particularly in products that support its growth and have a long-refrigerated shelf-life, poses a significant health risk, especially for vulnerable consumer groups such as pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals. A comprehensive analysis of L. monocytogenes in aquatic food products (AFPs) was conducted, examining the prevalence of the bacterium, the associated outbreaks, and the resulting deaths. Data from 66 studies, comprising a total of 19,373 samples, were analysed from the scientific literature to determine prevalence of the pathogen. The mean pooled prevalence of L. monocytogenes was 11 % (95 % CI: 8-14 %) among different AFPs categories. An overview of worldwide listeriosis outbreaks associated with contaminated AFPs between 1980 and 2023 was provided, totalling 1824 cases, including 41 deaths. Furthermore, a compilation of bio-based mitigation strategies was presented, including the use of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bacteriophages as bio-protective cultures to inhibit L. monocytogenes in AFPs. A variety of predictive microbiology models, based on growth prediction and interaction for L. monocytogenes, were reviewed to assess the effectiveness of control strategies in different types of AFPs, offering insights into pathogen behaviour throughout the production chain. The reported growth models describe primarily the impact of storage temperature on pathogen growth parameters, while interaction models, which reflect the inhibitory effect of LAB against L. monocytogenes, were generally defined using the Jameson-effect approach and Lotka-Volterra models' family (i.e., predator-prey models). Both models can be used to describe the simultaneous growth of two bacterial populations and their interactions (i.e., amensalism and antagonisms). Several Quantitative Risk assessment studies have been conducted for AFP, identifying the food category as a relevant contributor to Listeriosis risk, and providing predictive insight critical influence of storage temperature, food microbiota, product shelf-life, and population aging on the risk posed by L. monocytogenes. More importantly, this quantitative approach can serve as a key tool to assess the effectiveness of specific mitigation and intervention strategies to control the pathogen, such as sampling schemes or bio-preservation techniques.

AB  - Two series of heterocyclic steroidal pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines derived from dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and epiandrosterone (EPIA) were designed and synthesized, and these compounds were screened for their potential antiproliferation activities. The preliminary bioassay indicated that some of target compounds exhibited significantly good antiproliferation activities against human melanoma cell line (A875) and human hepatocellular carcinoma (Huh-7) cell lines compared with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and some of which present good antiproliferative activities as potential ALK inhibitors. The detailed analysis of structure-activity relationships (SARs) based on the inhibition activities, kinase assay, and molecular docking demonstrated that the antiproliferation activities of these steroidal pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine might be affected by the β-hydroxyl group of steroidal scaffold and the N atom of pyridine heterocycle. Especially, compound 4c has certain inhibitory effects on the tyrosine protein kinases ALK, CDK2/CyclinE1, FAK, CDK5/P35, CDK9/CyclinT1, CDK5/P25, PIM2, CDK2/CyclinA2, CDK1/CyclinB1, etc., and which displayed highest inhibitory effect on the kinases of ALK with inhibition rate 40.63 % at the concentration of 10 μM, which induced cell death in A875 cells at least partly (initially), by apoptosis.

AB  - Fosfomycin has been used to treat carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) infections. However, there is insufficient information on dosage adjustment among critically ill patients with renal impairment. This study aims to evaluate the attainment of PK/PD targets for different dosage regimens of CRAB treatment in critically ill patients based on their renal function. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to assess the probability of achieving time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (T > MIC) of 80% and 100% and to determine the cumulative fraction response (CFR) against institutional MICs. Our results demonstrated that administering fosfomycin 20-24 g/day to individuals with normal renal function (CrCl ≥60 mL/min) achieved the target at a MIC of ≤64 and ≤32 μg/mL during the first 24 h of treatment and at steady state, respectively. Notably, those with renal impairment achieved higher MIC values at a steady state despite dosage reduction. None of the regimens reached the target CFR. Our study suggested that administering fosfomycin at least 20 g/day to those with normal renal function provides sufficient exposure throughout the treatment course when the MIC value is ≤32 μg/mL. Less aggressive dosing regimens are advisable for patients with renal impairment. Additional clinical studies are necessary to verify our suggestions.

AB  - The widespread emergence of antibiotic resistance poses a substantial challenge to global health. While polymyxin E serves as a final option in treatment, its effectiveness is hindered by dose-related toxicity. A crucial strategy for addressing this issue involves incorporating an antibiotic adjuvant to enhance the antibiotic's efficacy and decrease the required dosage. Here, we reported a multifunctional antibacterial compound A33, containing a 2-aminothiazole scaffold. In vitro studies demonstrated that A33 in combination with polymyxin E inhibited the growth of various Gram-negative bacteria, meanwhile with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.5-4 μg/mL against twenty-three Gram-positive bacteria, including two drug-resistant strains. In vivo studies showed significant efficacy of the combined treatment of A33 and polymyxin E in a mouse infection model. The mice treated with compound A33 (64 mg/kg) and polymyxin E (0.5 mg/kg) in combination had a 100 % survival rate. Mechanistic studies suggested that A33 might exert its synergistic effect by targeting the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The ADMET data demonstrated that A33 possessed good pharmacokinetic profiles and drug-likeness properties. Overall, the optimized compound A33 assisted polymyxin E in combating various Gram-negative bacteria and exhibited bactericidal effects against drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria, offering a new potential therapeutic approach for managing mixed bacterial infections.

AB  - Soils are the largest reservoir of microplastics (MPs) on earth. Since MPs can remain in soils for a very long time, their effects are magnified. In this study, different concentrations of polyethylene (PE) MPs derived from commercial resins (0%, 1%, 7%, and 14%, represented as MP_0, MP_1, MP_7, and MP_14) were added to soils to assess the changes in the soils' chemical properties, enzyme activities, and bacterial communities during a 70-day incubation period. The results show that PE MP treatments with low concentrations differed from other treatments in terms of exchangeable Ca and Mg, whereas at high concentrations, the pH and availability of phosphate ions differed. Fluorescein diacetate (FDA), acid phosphatase (ACP), and N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (NAG) enzyme activities exhibited a dose-related trend with the addition of the PE MPs; however, the average FDA and ACP activities were significantly affected only by MP_14. Changes in the microbial communities were observed at both the phylum and family levels with all PE MP treatments. It was revealed that even a low dosage of PE MPs in soils can affect the functional microbes, and a greater impact is observed on those that can survive in polluted environments with limited resources.

AB  - Despite a wide range of available wound treatments, hard-to-heal wounds still pose a challenge. Hydrogels are often used as dressings for these wounds, because they sustain moisture in the wound environment, supporting the natural healing process. However, it is still not fully understood how physicochemical properties of hydrogel matrix affect the drug release process. Thus, detailed swelling kinetics examination coupled with modeling is needed together with studies on drug release. In this regard, several hydrogels based on plant-derived agar and modified with amikacin sulfate were investigated. The main properties of hydrogels were examined focusing on detailed swelling kinetics. Drug release was studied as microbiological activity against E. coli and S. Epidermidis strains. The obtained hydrogels were characterized by high swelling, reaching values in range from 465-1300 %, fitting the second order kinetics mode and exhibiting the quasi-Fickian diffusion properties. Furthermore, there was no correlation found between swelling properties and antibacterial activity against tested strains. The results confirmed that presented hydrogel materials have desirable properties for application as dressings for hard-to-heal wounds. The suggested compositions are a promising base for modification with other active substances (e. g., regenerative, anti-inflammatory) and studying the broader correlation between swelling and drug release.

AB  - Microorganisms can induce diseases with significant clinical implications for human health. Multidrug-resistant microorganisms have been on the rise worldwide over the past few decades, and no new antibiotics have been introduced to the market in a considerable amount of time. Such situation highlights the urgency of discovering new antimicrobial drugs to address this pressing issue. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify bioactive compounds against 15 species of bacteria and 5 species of fungi of clinical relevance through in vitro screening of 58 synthetic compounds from four chemical classes of our internal library of synthetic compounds.

AB  - We present the development of a phenyl oxazole methyl (POM) core structure with spirocyclic derivatives as part of our efforts to discover innovative anti-tuberculosis agents. Derivatives of spirocyclic POM were synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory effects on M.tuberculosis (M. tb) H37Rv. Notably, compound 5c displayed potent anti-tubercular activity with MIC value of 0.206 μM in culture broth medium. Furthermore MIC values of compound 5c against DS/MDR/pre-XDR clinical isolates ranged from 0.34 to 0.68 μg/mL, 0.17 to 0.68 μg/mL, and 0.17 to 0.34 μg/mL, respectively. Also, compound 5c with favorable ADME and PK properties was not cytotoxic to THP-1 human cells. Based on the spontaneous mutant generation, we have identified the target of compound 5c to be MmpL3. The computational docking study suggested its plausible binding mode against MmpL3. There is no approved drug targeting this target yet, and the outcomes of the presented research will contribute to the future discovery of novel anti-tuberculosis drugs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Fluconazole pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship was investigated in a few clinical settings and only limited studies regarding burned patients are available. Thus, the authors aimed to investigate fluconazole pharmacokinetics changes and its impact on antifungal therapy coverage against dose-dependent Candida spp. applying the PK/PD approach in critically ill severely burned patients. METHODS: Fluconazole was administered as a one-hour intravenous infusion of 200 mg q12h. Doses were increased according to the coverage based on the PK/PD approach. Blood samples were collected at the end of the infusion (1 RESULTS: Every pharmacokinetic parameter was reduced throughout all three sets of the study. Compared to healthy subjects, the volume of distribution was decreased about 3‒7 times, biological half-life was 2‒3 times shorter and total body clearance was slightly altered but statistically significant. Both half-life and total body clearance were correlated to the volume of distribution. Consequently, an increase in fluconazole daily dose was necessary to improve empiric coverage. CONCLUSIONS: Fluconazole pharmacokinetics is altered in critically ill severely burned patients, mainly related to the volume of distribution. Doses higher than usual may be necessary to reach the PK/PD target and guarantee antifungal coverage against dose-dependent Candida spp. up to MIC 32 mg/L.

AB  - Pharmaceutical wastewater often contains significant levels of antibiotic residues, which continuously induce and promote antibiotic resistance during the sewage treatment process. However, the specific impact of antibiotics on the emergence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), microbiomes, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), as well as the dose-response relationship remain unclear. Herein, through metagenomic sequencing and analysis, we investigated the fate, transmission, and associated risk of ARGs over a ten-year period of exposure to a gradient of sulfonamide antibiotics at a pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant (PWWTP), an associated wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and the receiving river. Through abundance comparison and principal co-ordinates analysis (PCoA), our results revealed distinct ARG, microbiome, and MGE profiles across different antibiotic concentrations. Notably, there was a decreasing trend in the abundance of ARGs and MGEs as the antibiotic concentrations were attenuated (p < 0.05). Further partial least squares path modeling analysis, Procrustes analysis and network analysis indicated that variation in MGEs and microbiomes were the driving forces behind the distribution of ARGs. Based on these findings, we proposed an antibiotic-microbiome-MGE-ARG dissemination paradigm, in which integrons as key drivers were closely associated with prevalent ARGs such as sul1, sul2, and aadA. With a focus on human pathogenic bacteria and the associated health risks of ARGs, we conducted pathogen source analysis and calculated the antibiotic resistome risk index (ARRI). Our findings highlighted potential risks associated with the transition from PWWTP to WWTP, raising concerns regarding risk amplification due to the mixed treatment of antibiotic-laden industrial wastewater and domestic sewage. Overall, the results of our study provide valuable information for optimizing wastewater treatment practices to better manage antibiotic resistance.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) display advantages over traditional antibiotics due to their broad spectrum of activity against various pathogens, and may even overcome bacterial drug resistance. However, despite their potential therapeutic benefits, widespread application of AMPs is limited by their instability, sensitivity to high salt concentrations, toxicity, and immunogenicity. Lipidation is a promising strategy in overcoming these drawbacks and potential problems for drug candidates. While N-terminal lipidation is a well-studied form of acylation of biologically active peptides, fatty acylation of the lysine side chain has still been poorly explored. In this study, we examined systematic introduction of octanoic (C

AB  - In this work, bismuth ferrites (BFO) nanoparticles were produced in the form of using sol-gel technique, followed by annealing in a tube furnace in temperatures from 400 °C to 650 °C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results showed the formation of small sizes nanoparticles (NPs) with high purity. Structural analysis displayed that annealing at 600 °C could make BFO NPs be fitted to rhombohedral space group (R3c), with small quantity of spurious phases. The sizes of the BFO nanoparticles determined by transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) are between 50 to 100 nm. To evaluate the efficiency of BFO in antimicrobial susceptibility tests, the nanoparticles were dispersed through cand tested agar diffusion method and dilution in a 96 well plate using a Gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram negative strain (Escherichia coli). The antibacterial activity of the BFO NPs was tested at concentrations of 2 mg/mL with MIC greater than 60 μg/mL for both bacteria.

AB  - AIMS: The current treatment for Buruli ulcer is based on empirical evidence of efficacy. However, there is an opportunity for shortening its duration and improving response rates. Evolving understanding of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships provides the basis for a stronger dose rationale for antibiotics. In conjunction with modelling and simulation, it is possible to identify dosing regimens with the highest probability of target attainment (PTA). This investigation aims to: (i) assess the dose rationale for a new combination therapy including amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMX/CLV) currently in clinical trials; and (ii) compare its performance with alternative dosing regimens including rifampicin, clarithromycin and AMX/CLV. METHODS: In vitro estimates of the minimum inhibitory (MIC) concentration were selected as a measure of the antibacterial activity of different drug combinations. Clinical trial simulations were used to characterize the concentration vs. time profiles of rifampicin, clarithromycin and amoxicillin in a virtual cohort of adult and paediatric patients, considering the effect of baseline covariates on disposition parameters and interindividual variability in exposure. The PTA of each regimen was then assessed using different thresholds of the time above MIC. RESULTS: A weight-banded dosing regimen including 150-600 mg rifampicin once daily, 250-1000 mg clarithromycin and AMX/CLV 22.5 mg/kg /1000 mg twice daily ensures higher PTA than the standard of care with AMX/CLV 45 mg/kg/2000 mg once daily. CONCLUSION: The higher PTA values support the proposed 4-drug combination (rifampicin, clarithromycin, AMX/CLV) currently under clinical investigation. Our findings also suggest that higher rifampicin doses might contribute to enhanced treatment efficacy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An increase in Staphylococcus aureus infections has been reported in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) over the last few years. This pathogen is commonly treated with vancomycin, an antibiotic for which therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is recommended. Updated guidelines were recently published regarding new targets of exposure for the TDM of vancomycin through a Bayesian approach, using population pharmacokinetic (popPK) models. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the predictive performance of vancomycin popPK models in pediatric patients with CF and to recommend optimal initial dosing regimens based on simulations. METHODS: Patient data were collected from two centers in Canada, and a literature review was conducted to identify all published vancomycin popPK models for pediatric CF patients. External evaluation and simulations were performed according to patient and occasion of treatment. RESULTS: A total of 53 vancomycin concentrations were collected from six pediatric CF patients. Only two popPK models of vancomycin for pediatric CF patients were identified through the literature review. The external evaluation results for both centers combined revealed a population bias of 28.1% and an imprecision of 33.7%. A re-estimation of parameters was performed to improve predictive performance. The optimal initial dosing regimen was 15 mg/kg/dose administered every 6 hours according to the per occasion remodel. CONCLUSION: The predictive performance and identified optimal initial dosing regimens associated with the model were different depending on the data used, showing external evaluation's importance before implementing a model in clinical practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Orphaned children are often deprived of quality care, making them more susceptible to diseases due to inadequate hand hygiene. The study aimed to assess the prevalence of hand hygiene practices and detect bacterial loads on children's hands before and after hygiene interventions in an orphanage school. METHODS: The study enrolled all the orphan children registered with the Save Our Souls children's orphanage school in Pakistan. Handwashing practices and swab samples from the hand was collected to evaluate the impact of hand hygiene practices on bacterial load. The Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment model was used to predict the health risk. RESULTS: The study identified the 2 most common bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The bacterial contamination was significantly reduced after the intervention (S aureus 166 Colony-forming unit (CFU) /mL and E coli 185 CFU/mL). The higher bacterial ingestion rate was attributed to hand contamination and increased bacteria transfer from hand to mouth. CONCLUSIONS: The multicomponent hand hygiene intervention showed improvement in accessibility to hand hygiene resources and practices. The findings underscore the need for hygiene interventions in orphanage schools to improve health and educational outcomes.

AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged as a major pathogen causing infections in hospitals and the community, and there is an urgent need for the development of novel antibacterials to combat MRSA infections. Herein, a series of amphiphilic honokiol derivatives containing an oxazolethione moiety were prepared and evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial and hemolytic activities. The screened optimal derivative, I3, exhibited potent in vitro antibacterial activity against S. aureus and clinical MRSA isolates with MIC values of 2-4 μg/mL, which was superior to vancomycin in terms of its rapid bactericidal properties and was less susceptible to the development of resistance. The SARs analysis indicated that amphiphilic honokiol derivatives with fluorine substituents had better antibacterial activity than those with chlorine and bromine substituents. In vitro and in vivo toxicity studies revealed that I3 has relatively low toxicity. In a MRSA-infected mouse skin abscess model, I3 (5 mg/kg) effectively killed MRSA at the infected site and attenuated the inflammation effects, comparable to vancomycin. In a MRSA-infected mouse sepsis model, I3 (12 mg/kg) was found to significantly reduce the bacterial load in infected mice and increase survival of infected mice. Mechanistic studies indicated that I3 has membrane targeting properties and can interact with phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL) of MRSA cell membranes, thereby disrupting MRSA cell membranes, further inducing the increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein and DNA leakage to achieve rapid bactericidal effects. Finally, we hope that I3 is a potential candidate molecule for the development of antibiotics to conquer superbacteria-related infections.

AB  - Nitrobenzothiazinones (BTZs) are undergoing late-stage development as a novel class of potent antitubercular drug candidates with two compounds in clinical phases. BTZs inhibit decaprenylphosphoryl-β-d-ribose oxidase 1 (DprE1), a key enzyme in cell wall biosynthesis of mycobacteria. Their mechanism of action involves an in-situ-reduction of the nitro moiety to a reactive nitroso intermediate capable of covalent binding to Cys387 in the catalytic cavity. The electron-deficient nature of the aromatic core is a key driver for the formation of hydride-Meisenheimer complexes (HMC) as main metabolites in vivo. To mimic the electrophilic character of the nitroso moiety, bioisosteric replacement with different electrophilic warheads was attempted to reduce HMC formation without compromising covalent reactivity. Herein, we synthesized and characterized various covalent warheads covering different reaction principles. Covalent inhibition was confirmed for most active antimycobacterial compounds by enzymatic inhibition assays and peptide fragment analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Daptomycin's efficacy and toxicity are closely related to its exposure, which can vary widely among individuals. The patient, a 59-year-old male with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 12 mL/min/1.73 m² and a weight of 64 kg, was treated with 850 mg of daptomycin every other day for infective endocarditis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). For patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², the dosing recommendations are not explicitly defined in the endocarditis guidelines. Subsequently, the pharmacology department was contacted to adjust the dosage. METHODS: A population pharmacokinetic model developed by Dvorchik et al. was used for Bayesian estimation of the patient's pharmacokinetic parameters. The 24-hour area under the curve (AUC24) of daptomycin was calculated at steady state using peak and trough plasma samples. RESULTS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the MRSA strain was 0.25 mg/L. An AUC24/MIC ratio below 666 is associated with higher mortality risk, while an AUC24 above 939 h·mg/L correlates with increased risk of muscular toxicity. Initial AUC24 estimation was 1091 h·mg/L. Following a dosage reduction to 700 mg every other day, the AUC24 increased to 1600 h·mg/L. Further reduction to 500 mg every other day brought the AUC24 down to 750 h mg/L, with two subsequent measurements showing consistent AUC24 values of 500 h·mg/L, which is within the target range. CONCLUSIONS: Daptomycin ended 6 weeks after the initial negative blood culture, with no adverse effects or recurrence of MRSA infection. This case underscores the need for therapeutic drug monitoring and a multidisciplinary approach to adjust daptomycin doses in patients with renal impairment.

AB  - In previous studies, we demonstrated the potent activity of a library of 25 N,N'-disubstituted diamines (NNDDA) toward Trypanosomatid and Apicomplexa parasites. Considering the structure similarity between this collection and SQ109, an antituberculosis compound, and its compelling antiparasitic properties, we aimed to repurpose this library for tuberculosis treatment. We assayed this collection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv and M. avium, obtaining several compounds with MIC values below 10 µM. The most active analogs were also evaluated against M. smegmatis, a non-pathogenic species, and the non-tuberculosis mycobacteria M. abscessus, M. kansasii, and M. fortuitum. 3c stands out as the lead mycobacterial compound of the collection, with potent activity against M. tuberculosis (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC] = 3.4 µM) and moderate activity against M. smegmatis, M. kansasii, and M. fortuitum (all with MIC values of 26.8 µM). To unravel the mechanism of action, we employed the web-based platform Polypharmacology Browser 2 (PPB2), obtaining carbonic anhydrases as potential drug targets. Nevertheless, none of the compounds displayed experimental inhibition. In summary, our study confirms the validity of the repurposing approach and underscores the antimycobacterial potential of NNDDA compounds, especially the analog 3c, setting a stepping stone for further studies.

AB  - Iron is an essential micronutrient for almost every living organism, namely pathogenic bacteria. In an infection scenario, host-pathogen competitive relationships for the element are present and Fe withholding is a well known response of the host. Also, bacterial resistance is a major concern that can compromise public health and the WHO underlines an urgent need to search for new pharmaceutical ingredients or strategies to fight opportunistic bacteria. Iron metabolism, and in particular, deprivation is a strategy that currently constitutes another option to fight bacterial infection. In this work we report the synthesis of a new hexadentate chelator with enhanced hydrophilicity (MRHT) and the improved synthesis of two other chelators. The affinity towards charged and non-charged phospholipid bilayers was evaluated for three hexadentate chelators: MRHT, CP256 and RH8b using NMR and EPR spectroscopies. The results revealed that these structures, bearing 3,4-HPO units have a high affinity towards the hydrophilic region of the phospholipid bilayer. From the three hexadentate chelators, MRHT stood out, especially for liposomes with a charged surface, suggesting that this molecule could more efficiently compete with natural siderophores, creating an iron gradient near bacteria organisms.

AB  - In swine farming, animals develop diseases that require the use of antibiotics. In-feed antibiotics as growth promoters have been banned due to the increasing concern of antimicrobial resistance. Seaweeds offer bioactive molecules with antibacterial and antioxidant properties. The aim was to estimate the in vitro properties of seaweed extracts: Ascophyllum nodosum (AN), Palmaria palmata (PP), Ulva lactuca (UL), and 1:1 mixes (ANPP, ANUL, PPUL). Escherichia coli strains were used to test for growth inhibitory activity, and chemical-based assays were performed for antioxidant properties. The treatments were 2 (with/without Escherichia coli) × 2 (F4 + and F18 +) × 5 doses (0, 1.44, 2.87, 5.75, 11.50, and 23.0 mg/mL). Bacteria were supplemented with seaweed extracts, and growth was monitored. The antioxidant activity was assessed with 6 doses (0, 1, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 600 mg/mL) × 6 compounds using two chemical assays. Data were evaluated through SAS. The results showed that AN and UL significantly inhibited (p < 0.05) the growth of F4 + and F18 +. PP and mixes did not display an inhibition of the bacteria growth. AN, PP, UL extracts, and mixes exhibited antioxidant activities, with AN showing the strongest dose-response. Thus, AN and UL seaweed extracts reveal promising antibacterial and antioxidant effects and may be candidates for in-feed additives.

AB  - Candida auris (C. auris) has caused notable outbreaks across the globe in last decade and emerged as a life-threatening human pathogenic fungus. Despite significant advances in antifungal research, the drug resistance mechanisms in C. auris still remain elusive. Under such pressing circumstances, research on identification of new antifungal compounds is of immense interest. Thus, our studies aimed at identifying novel drug candidates and elucidate their biological targets in C. auris. After screening of several series of synthetic and hemisynthetic compounds from JUNIA chemical library, compounds C4 (butyl 2-(4-chlorophenyl)hydrazine-1-carboxylate) and C13 (phenyl 2-(4-chlorophenyl) hydrazine-1-carboxylate), belonging to the carbazate series, were identified to display considerable antifungal activities against C. auris as well as its fluconazole resistant isolates. Elucidation of biological targets revealed that C4 and C13 lead to changes in polysaccharide composition of the cell wall and disrupt vacuole homeostasis. Mechanistic insights further unravelled inhibited efflux pump activities of ATP binding cassette transporters and depleted ergosterol content. Additionally, C4 and C13 cause mitochondrial dysfunction and confer oxidative stress. Furthermore, both C4 and C13 impair biofilm formation in C. auris. The in vivo efficacy of C4 and C13 were demonstrated in Caenorhabditis elegans model after C. auris infection showing reduced mortality of the nematodes. Together, promising antifungal properties were observed for C4 and C13 against C. auris that warrant further investigations. To summarise, collected data pave the way for the design and development of future first-in-class antifungal drugs.

AB  - Mother's milk contains diverse bacterial communities, although their impact on microbial colonization in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW, <1,500 g) infants remains unknown. Here, we examine relationships between the microbiota in preterm mother's milk and the VLBW infant gut across initial hospitalization (n = 94 mother-infant dyads, 422 milk-stool pairs). Shared zero-radius operational taxonomic units (zOTUs) between milk-stool pairs account for ∼30%-40% of zOTUs in the VLBW infant's gut. We show dose-response relationships between intakes of several genera from milk and their concentrations in the infant's gut. These relationships and those related to microbial sharing change temporally and are modified by in-hospital feeding practices (especially direct breastfeeding) and maternal-infant antibiotic use. Correlations also exist between milk and stool microbial consortia, suggesting that multiple milk microbes may influence overall gut communities together. These results highlight that the mother's milk microbiota may shape the gut colonization of VLBW infants by delivering specific bacteria and through intricate microbial interactions.

AB  - Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) cause chronic inflammation of the gastric mucosa which can lead to epithelial atrophy and metaplasia resulting in peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. The increasing resistance of H. pylori to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics used to treat the infection is a serious problem. However, it has been confirmed that the introduction of effective anti-H. pylori therapy can prevent the progression to cancerous changes. This problem calls for the search for new and effective therapies. Xanthones are a group of compounds with extensive biological activities, including antibacterial activity, also against H. pylori. Addressing this issue, the aim of the study was to evaluate the potential of a group of 13 xanthone derivatives against susceptible and resistant H. pylori strains. Moreover, our objective was to conduct tests aimed at determining their ability to inhibit biofilm formation. The antimicrobial evaluation revealed that benzylpiperazine coupled at the C-2 position to xanthone (compounds C11 and C12) had good selective bacteriostatic activity against reference and clinical H. pylori strains (MBC/MIC ratio >4) but with no activity against other bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Lactobacillus paracasei. Analysis of the activity of compounds C11 and C12 against the biofilm formed by H. pylori strain ATCC 700684, and the clinical strain showed that these compounds caused a significant reduction in the amount of biofilm produced (5-20×). Moreover, cell viability analysis confirmed a 3-4× reduction in the viability of cells forming biofilm after treatment with C11 and C12. Finally,both compounds did not impair human fibroblast viability at tested concentrations and were not mutagenic in the Ames test. Therefore, they could be promising leads as antibacterial candidates for multidrug-resistant strains of H. pylori.

AB  - The growing threat of bacterial resistance to antibiotics has led to the rise of anti-virulence strategies as a promising approach. These strategies aim to disarm bacterial pathogens and improve their clearance by the host immune system. Lipopolysaccharide, a key virulence factor in Gram-negative bacteria, has been identified as a potential target for anti-virulence agents. In this study, we focus on inhibiting HldA and HldE, bacterial enzymes from the heptose biosynthesis pathway, which plays a key role in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. We present the synthesis of two fluorinated non-hydrolysable heptose phosphate analogues. Additionally, the inhibitory activity of a family of eight heptose phosphate analogues against HldA and HldE was assessed. This evaluation revealed inhibitors with affinities in the low μM range, with the most potent compound showing inhibition constant values of 15.4 μM for HldA and 16.9 μM for HldE. The requirement for a phosphate group at the C-7 position was deemed essential for inhibitory activity, while the presence of a hydroxy anomeric group was found to be beneficial, a phenomenon rationalized through computational modeling. Additionally, the introduction of a single fluorine atom α to the phosphonate moiety conferred a slight advantage for inhibition. These findings suggest that mimicking the structure of d-glycero-β-d-manno-heptose 1,7-bisphosphate, the product of the phosphorylation step in heptose biosynthesis, could be a promising strategy to disrupt this biosynthetic pathway. In terms of the in vivo effects, these heptose phosphate analogues neither demonstrated significant LPS-disrupting effects nor exhibited growth inhibitory activity on their own. Additionally, they did not alter the susceptibility of bacteria to hydrophobic antibiotics. The highly charged nature of these molecules may hinder their ability to penetrate the bacterial cell wall. To overcome this limitation, alternative strategies such as incorporating protecting groups that facilitate their entry and can subsequently be cleaved within the bacterial cytoplasm could be explored.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance poses a global health concern and develops a need to discover novel antimicrobial agents or targets to tackle this problem. Fluoroquinolone (FN), a DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV inhibitor, has helped to conquer antimicrobial resistance as it provides flexibility to researchers to rationally modify its structure to increase potency and efficacy. This review provides insights into the rational modification of FNs, the causes of resistance to FNs, and the mechanism of action of FNs. Herein, we have explored the latest advancements in antimicrobial activities of FN analogues and the effect of various substitutions with a focus on utilizing the FN nucleus to search for novel potential antimicrobial candidates. Moreover, this review also provides a comparative analysis of two widely prescribed FNs that are ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, explaining their rationale for their design, structure-activity relationships (SAR), causes of resistance, and mechanistic studies. These insights will prove advantageous for new researchers by aiding them in designing novel and effective FN-based compounds to combat antimicrobial resistance.

AB  - There is an emerging necessity for improved therapies against Candida-related infections, with significant implications for global healthcare. Current antifungal agents, limited in number, target specific pathways, but resistance remains a concern. Flucytosine (5FC) exhibits antifungal activity, particularly against Candida. However, monotherapy efficacy is limited, necessitating combination treatments. Herein, we report PEGylated squalene-based nanocarriers for 5FC loading, aiming to enhance its monotherapy efficacy against Candida strains. The loading of 5FC within micelles was achieved using the ultrasound-assisted solvent evaporation method. The 5FC-loaded micelles, together with non-loaded micelles, were thoroughly characterized and analyzed. STEM and DLS analysis confirmed the core-shell morphology with nanometric dimensions along with improved colloidal stability. The quantification of drug loading efficiency and drug loading capacity was calculated using the UV-Vis technique. The in vitro drug-release studies in simulated physiological conditions showed sustained release within 48 hours. Moreover, the release kinetics calculated using mathematical models showed a Fickian diffusion drug release mechanism in simulated physiological conditions with a slower diffusion rate. The in vitro antifungal activity was tested on Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, and Candida parapsilosis. The results showed improved antifungal activity for the nanotherapeutic and unchanged in vitro toxicity toward normal cells, suggesting promising advancements in 5FC therapy.

AB  - Successful antimicrobial therapy depends on achieving optimal drug concentrations within individual patients. Inter-patient variability in pharmacokinetics (PK) and differences in pathogen susceptibility (reflected in the minimum inhibitory concentration, [MIC]) necessitate personalised approaches. Dose individualisation strategies aim to address this challenge, improving treatment outcomes and minimising the risk of toxicity and antimicrobial resistance. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), with the application of population pharmacokinetic (popPK) models, enables model-informed precision dosing (MIPD). PopPK models mathematically describe drug behaviour across populations and can be combined with patient-specific TDM data to optimise dosing regimens. The integration of machine learning (ML) techniques promises to further enhance dose individualisation by identifying complex patterns within extensive datasets. Implementing these approaches involves challenges, including rigorous model selection and validation to ensure suitability for target populations. Understanding the relationship between drug exposure and clinical outcomes is crucial, as is striking a balance between model complexity and clinical usability. Additionally, regulatory compliance, outcome measurement, and practical considerations for software implementation will be addressed. Emerging technologies, such as real-time biosensors, hold the potential for revolutionising TDM by enabling continuous monitoring, immediate and frequent dose adjustments, and near patient testing. The ongoing integration of TDM, advanced modelling techniques, and ML within the evolving digital health care landscape offers a potential for enhancing antimicrobial therapy. Careful attention to model development, validation, and ethical considerations of the applied techniques is paramount for successfully optimising antimicrobial treatment for the individual patient.

However, limited studies have investigated the influence of gut microbiota on these two significant factors. In this study, we utilized in vitro gastrointestinal simulators, specifically the RIVM-M (with human gut microbial communities) and the RIVM model (without gut microbial communities), to determine the bioaccessibility of Cd in rice. Additionally, we employed the Caco-2 cell model to assess bioavailability. Our findings provide compelling evidence that gut microbiota significantly reduces Cd bioaccessibility and bioavailability (p<0.05). Notably, strong in vivo-in vitro correlations (IVIVC) were observed between the in vitro bioaccessibilities and bioavailabilities, as compared to the results obtained from an in vivo mouse bioassay (R

AB  - To facilitate the development of novel agricultural succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicides, we synthesized three series of derivatives by introducing phenyl pyrazole fragments into the structure of pyrazol-4-yl amides. The results of the bioactivity assay showed that most of the target compounds possessed varying degrees of inhibitory activity against the tested fungi. At a concentration of 100 mg/L, the compound B8 exhibited effective protective activity against S. sclerotiorum in vivo. Molecular docking analysis and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) inhibition assay indicated that B8 was not a potential SDHI. The preliminary antifungal mechanism of studies showed that B8 induced a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and severe lipid peroxidation damage in S. sclerotiorum mycelium, resulting in mycelial rupture and disruption of the integrity of the cell membrane and leakage of soluble proteins, soluble sugars and nucleic acids. Further transcriptome analysis showed that compound B8 blocked various metabolic pathways by downregulating the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) catalase, disrupting hydrogen peroxide hydrolysis, accelerating membrane oxidative damage, and upregulating neutral ceramidase, accelerating sphingolipid metabolism to disrupt cell membrane structure and cell proliferation and differentiation, potentially accelerating cell death. The above results indicated that the potential target of these dis-pyrazole carboxamide derivatives may be the cell membrane of pathogenic fungi.

AB  - Promoting endogenous neurogenesis for brain repair is emerging as a promising strategy to mitigate the functional impairments associated with various neurological disorders characterized by neuronal death. Diterpenes featuring tigliane, ingenane, jatrophane and lathyrane skeletons, frequently found in Euphorbia plant species, are known protein kinase C (PKC) activators and exhibit a wide variety of pharmacological properties, including the stimulation of neurogenesis. Microbial transformation of these diterpenes represents a green and sustainable methodology that offers a hitherto little explored approach to obtaining novel derivatives and exploring structure-activity relationships. In the present study, we report the biotransformation of euphoboetirane A (4) and epoxyboetirane A (5), two lathyrane diterpenoids isolated from Euphorbia boetica, by Mucor circinelloides MC NRRL3631. Our findings revealed the production of nine biotransformation products (6-14), including jatrophane derivatives originated through an unprecedented rearrangement from the parent lathyranes. The chemical structures and absolute configurations of the new compounds were elucidated through comprehensive analysis using NMR and ECD spectroscopy, as well as MS. The study evaluated how principal metabolites and their derivatives affect TGFα and NRG1 release, as well as their potential to promote proliferation or differentiation in cultures of NSC isolated from the SVZ of adult mice. In order to shed some light on the mechanisms underlying the ability of 12 as a neurogenic compound, the interactions of selected compounds with PKC δ-C1B were analyzed through molecular docking and molecular dynamics. Based on these, it clearly appears that the ability of compound 12 to form both acceptor and donor hydrogen bonds with certain amino acid residues in the enzyme pocket leads to a higher affinity compound-PKC complex, which correlates with the observed biological activity.

AB  - New antibacterial compounds are urgently needed, especially for infections caused by the top-priority Gram-negative bacteria that are increasingly difficult to treat. Lipid A is a key component of the Gram-negative outer membrane and the LpxH enzyme plays an important role in its biosynthesis, making it a promising antibacterial target. Inspired by previously reported ortho-N-methyl-sulfonamidobenzamide-based LpxH inhibitors, novel benzamide substitutions were explored in this work to assess their in vitro activity. Our findings reveal that maintaining wild-type antibacterial activity necessitates removal of the N-methyl group when shifting the ortho-N-methyl-sulfonamide to the meta-position. This discovery led to the synthesis of meta-sulfonamidobenzamide analogs with potent antibacterial activity and enzyme inhibition. Moreover, we demonstrate that modifying the benzamide scaffold can alter blocking of the cardiac voltage-gated potassium ion channel hERG. Furthermore, two LpxH-bound X-ray structures show how the enzyme-ligand interactions of the meta-sulfonamidobenzamide analogs differ from those of the previously reported ortho analogs. Overall, our study has identified meta-sulfonamidobenzamide derivatives as promising LpxH inhibitors with the potential for optimization in future antibacterial hit-to-lead programs.

AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is responsible for the most endemic alphavirus infections called Chikungunya. The endemicity of Chikungunya has increased over the past two decades, and it is a pathogen with pandemic potential. There is currently no approved direct-acting antiviral to treat the disease. As part of our antiviral drug discovery program focused on alphaviruses and the non-structural protein 2 protease, we discovered that J12 and J13 can inhibit CHIKV nsP2 protease and block the replication of CHIKV in cell cultures. Both compounds are metabolically stable to human liver microsomal and S9 enzymes. J13 has excellent oral bioavailability in pharmacokinetics studies in mice and ameliorated Chikungunya symptoms in preliminary efficacy studies in mice. J13 exhibited an excellent safety profile in in vitro safety pharmacology and off-target screening assays, making J13 and its analogs good candidates for drug development against Chikungunya.

AB  - Based on ethnomedicinal and chemotaxonomic records of Ficus plants, Ficus sur Forssk was studied in the search for bioactive compounds. Eleven known compounds including mixture α -amyrin acetate and β -amyrin acetate (1 and 2), lupeol (3), 3β-acetoxy-olean-12-en-11-one (4), lupenyl acetate (5), taraxastan-3,20-diol (6), 3'- (3-methylbut-2-enyl) biochanin A (7), derrone (8), quercetin (9), stigmasterol (10), and stigmasterol glycoside (11) were isolated from stem barks of Ficus sur Forssk. Their structures were obtained through analysis of spectroscopic data 1D and 2D NMR), mass spectrometry, and by comparison of these data with the literature. Nine isolated compounds (1-7, 10, 11) were tested as the active wighteone metabolite previously isolated from the roots of this plant against the human HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells and a small panel of sensitive microbial strains for structure- activity relationship purpose. The compounds didn't show any activity. With the aim of understanding the impact of the structural difference between wighteone metabolite and its analogs, the former were cross-docked to evaluate their anticancer properties via the apoptosis pathway. Wighteone metabolite proved to be the best ligand confirming its previous bioassay result. Thus, the current study lays the framework for the further optimization of wighteone metabolite regarding its anticancer activity.

AB  - Ubiquinone mimics known as quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs) are one of the most prominent fungicides used to protect crops in the agricultural industry. Due to chemotype similarities with known QoIs, peniciaculin A, a triaryl natural product, was proposed to exhibit similar broad spectrum antifungal activity against phytopathogens. Instability of the tertiary alcohol and phenol motif, however, prompted exploration of the antifungal properties of simplified analogues to probe possible overlap in mechanism of action between the natural product and QoIs. Peniciaculin A inspired analogues mimicking known QoI scaffolds displayed broad spectrum antifungal activity while those containing scaffolds dissimilar to QoIs possessed negligible bioactivity. These activity profiles suggest peniciaculin A is likely acting as a QoI.

AB  - Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections are becoming a life-threatening issue in public health; therefore, it is urgent to develop novel antibacterial agents for treating infections caused by MDR bacteria. The 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (PPD) derivative 9 was identified as a novel antibacterial hit compound in screening of our small synthetic natural product-like (NPL) library. A series of novel PPD derivatives with heterocyclic rings fused at the C-2 and C-3 positions of the A-ring were synthesized and their antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) Newman strain and MDR S. aureus strains (USA300, NRS-1, NRS-70, NRS-100, NRS-108, NRS-271, XJ017, and XJ036) were evaluated. Among these compounds, quinoxaline derivative 56 (SH617) exhibited the highest activity with MICs of 0.5-4 μg/mL against the S. aureus Newman strain and the eight MDR S. aureus strains. Its antibacterial activity was comparable to that of the positive control, vancomycin. In the zebrafish, 56 revealed no obvious toxicity even at a high administered dose. In vivo, following a lethal infection induced by USA300 strains in zebrafish, 56 exhibited significantly increased survival rates in a dose-dependent manner.

AB  - The accuracy of predictive microbial models used in quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) relies on the relevancy of conditions influencing growth or inactivation. The continued use of log-linear models in studies remains widespread, despite evidence that they fail to accurately account for biphasic kinetics or include parameters to account for the effect of environmental conditions within the model equation. Although many experimental studies detail conditions of interest, studies that do not do so lead to uncertainty in QMRA modeling because the applicability of the predictive microbial models to the conditions in the risk scenarios is questionable or must be extrapolated. The current study systematically reviewed 65 articles that provided quantitative data and documented the conditions influencing the inactivation or growth of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157:H7 in leafy greens. The conditions were identified and categorized as environmental, biological, chemical, and/or processing. Our study found that temperature (n = 37 studies) and sanitizing and washing procedures (n = 12 studies) were the most studied conditions in the farm-to-table continuum of leafy greens. In addition, relative humidity was also established to affect growth and inactivation in more than one stage in the continuum. This study proposes the evaluation of the interactive effects of multiple conditions in processing and storage stages from controlled experiments as they relate to the fate of STEC O157:H7 in leafy greens for future quantitative analysis.

AB  - Pluchea indica (L.) Less. is a medicinal plant native to Asia. Traditionally, it is known for numerous traditional uses, such as treatments for fever, cough, and digestive issues. The present investigation aims to determine the chemical compositions of essential oils from its fresh leaves and stem barks. By using hydro-distillation and the GC-FID/MS (gas chromatography-flame ionization detection/mass spectrometry) analysis, the studied samples were dominated by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (76.8-82.2 %) and their oxygenated derivatives (8.4-19.0 %). β-Selinene (42.0-43.5 %) and silphinene (21.1-22.9 %) were the main compounds. Significantly, the stem bark essential oil strongly monitored the growth of four cancer cell lines K562, HeLa, HepG2, and MCF-7 with IC

AB  - PURPOSE: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major health threat worldwide, and the spread of drug-resistant (DR) TB impedes the reduction of the global disease burden. Ebselen (EbSe) targets bacterial thioredoxin reductase (bTrxR) and causes an imbalance in the redox status of bacteria. Previous work has shown that the synergistic action of bTrxR and sensitization to common antibiotics by EbSe is a promising strategy for the treatment of DR pathogens. Thus, we aimed to evaluate whether EbSe could enhance anti-TB drugs against  METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RFP), and streptomycin (SM) against  RESULTS: The results reveal that EbSe acts as an antibiotic adjuvant over SM on  CONCLUSION: The above studies suggest that EbSe significantly enhanced the anti-

AB  - Spectinamides are a novel class of narrow-spectrum antitubercular agents with the potential to treat drug-resistant tuberculosis infections. Spectinamide 1810 has shown a good safety record following subcutaneous injection in mice or infusion in rats but exhibits transient acute toxicity following bolus administration in either species. To improve the therapeutic index of 1810, an injectable prodrug strategy was explored. The injectable phosphate prodrug 3408 has a superior maximum tolerated dose compared to 1810 or Gentamicin. Following intravenous administration in rodents, prodrug 3408 was quickly converted to 1810. The resulting 1810 exposure and pharmacokinetic profile after 3408 administration was identical to equivalent molar amounts of 1810 given directly by intravenous administration. 3408 and the parent 1810 exhibited similar overall efficacy in a BALB/c acute tuberculosis efficacy model. Delivery of 1810 in phosphate prodrug form, therefore, holds the potential to improve further the therapeutic index of an already promising tuberculosis antibiotic.

AB  - The eradication of Helicobacter pylori, the etiologic agent of gastric ulcer and adenocarcinoma, is a big concern in clinics due to the increasing drug resistance phenomena and the limited number of efficacious treatment options. The exploitation of the H. pylori carbonic anhydrases (HpCAs) as promising pharmacological targets has been validated by the antibacterial activity of previously reported CA inhibitors due to the role of these enzymes in the bacterium survival in the gastric mucosa. The development of new HpCA inhibitors seems to be on the way to filling the existing antibiotics gap. Due to the recent evidence on the ability of the coumarin scaffold to inhibit microbial α-CAs, a large library of derivatives has been developed by means of a pH-regulated cyclization reaction of coumarin-bearing acyl thiosemicarbazide intermediates. The obtained 1,3,4-thiadiazoles (10-18a,b) and 1,2,4-triazole-3-thiones (19-26a,b) were found to strongly and selectively inhibit HpαCA and computational studies were fundamental to gaining an understanding of the interaction networks governing the enzyme-inhibitor complex. Antibacterial evaluations on H. pylori ATCC 43504 highlighted some compounds that maintained potency on a resistant clinical isolate. Also, their combinations with metronidazole decreased both the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration values of the antibiotic, with no synergistic effect.

AB  - AIMS: Population pharmacokinetics (PK) models may be effective in improving antibiotic exposure with individualized dosing. The aim of the study is to assess cefazolin exposure using a population PK model in critically ill children. METHODS: We conducted a single-centre observational study including children under 18 years old who had cefazolin plasma monitoring before and after a cefazolin model implementation. The first concentration at steady state of each cefazolin course was analysed. The optimal exposure was defined by concentration values ranging from free concentration over four times the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for 100% of the dosing interval to total trough or plateau concentration under 100 mg. L RESULTS: A total of 58 patients were included, of whom 39 and 19 children received conventional dosing or model-informed dosing, respectively. Median [range] age was 2.3 [0.1-17] years old, and median weight was 14.2 [2.9-72] kg. There were more continuous infusions (CI) in the model group than in the conventional group (n = 19/19 [100%] vs. n = 23/39 [59%]). Compared to conventional dosing, model-informed dosing provided more optimal exposure (n = 17/39 [44%] vs. n = 15/19 [79%], P = .01) and less underexposure (n = 18/39 [46%] vs. n = 2/19 [10%], P = .008), without increasing overexposure (n = 4/39 [10%] vs. n = 2/19 [11%], P = 1). Moreover, the time to C-reactive protein decrease by 50% was significantly shorter in the model group than the conventional group (3 [0.5-13] vs. 4 [1-34]; P = .045). CONCLUSIONS: Use of individualized cefazolin model-informed dosing improves critically ill children's exposure. Further studies are needed to assess the clinical benefit of cefazolin PK model application.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to investigate the optimal dietary calcium (Ca) levels in Jing Tint 6 layer chicks fed different sources of zinc (Zn). The diets were formulated using 2 different Zn sources: organic Zn (80 mg/kg Zn as HMZn) and inorganic Zn (80 mg/kg Zn as sulfate). For each Zn source, 5 diets were formulated to contain Ca levels of 0.80, 0.90, 1.03, 1.10, and 1.20%. Results showed that dietary Ca levels had a significant effect on body weight gain (BWG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) (P < 0.05). In addition, BWG was significantly enhanced by the organic Zn diets (P < 0.05). Dietary Ca levels significantly affected tibia length (P < 0.05) and serum Ca and P contents (P < 0.05) but did not affect serum total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels (P > 0.05). The apparent total tract retention coefficients (ATTRC) of Ca showed a quadratic trend (P < 0.05) with increasing Ca levels. Furthermore, organic Zn diets reduced excreta Ca output and enhanced the ATTRC of Ca in birds on d 42 compared with inorganic Zn diets. The optimal dietary Ca levels were estimated as 0.93, 0.94, and 0.96% for birds fed organic diets and 1.07, 0.99 and 0.94% for birds fed inorganic diets using nonlinear models based on the criteria of BWG, tibial length, and serum P, respectively. In general, organic Zn supplementation improved growth performance and reduced the calcium requirements of birds on d 42.

AB  - Convalescent sera, rich in pathogen-specific antibodies, offers passive immunity to patients with infectious diseases. Screening assays using convalescent sera are crucial for evaluating therapeutic efficacy, selecting suitable serum donors, and standardizing assays. They measure antibody levels, neutralizing potential, and specificity against viruses like SARS-CoV-2, ensuring therapeutic serum contains potent antibodies. Standardized procedures enable reliable results and wider adoption of serum therapy for COVID-19. We have developed a high-content image-based assay for screening convalescent sera against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Using various cell lines, we identified optimal candidates, employed immunofluorescence to visualize infected cells, and assessed neutralizing antibody efficacy. Screening convalescent sera for therapeutic potential identified neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Dose-response analysis showed variable neutralizing activity, with some sera exhibiting broad neutralization. Additionally, we explored the synergy between neutralizing sera and β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC), an initial metabolite of molnupiravir. These assays enhance serum therapy's benefits for COVID-19 treatment and aid in understanding neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants, addressing viral challenges.

AB  - Revascularization surgery for the symptomatic hemisphere with hemodynamic impairment is effective for Moyamoya vasculopathy patients. However, careful patient selection is crucial and ideally supported by advanced quantitative hemodynamic imaging. Recently, blood oxygenation level-dependent cerebrovascular reactivity (BOLD-CVR) and quantitative magnetic resonance angiography with non-invasive optimal vessel analysis (qMRA-NOVA) have gained prominence in assessing these patients. This study aims to present the results of BOLD-CVR and qMRA-NOVA imaging along with the changes in cerebral hemodynamics and flow status following flow augmentation with superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass in our Moyamoya vasculopathy patient cohort. Symptomatic patients with Moyamoya vasculopathy treated at the Clinical Neuroscience Center of the University Hospital Zurich who underwent hemodynamic and flow imaging (BOLD-CVR and qMRA-NOVA) before and after bypass were included in the analysis. Reduced hemispheric volume flow rates, as well as impaired BOLD-CVR, were measured in all 12 patients with Moyamoya vasculopathy before STA-MCA bypass surgery. Following the surgical procedure, post-operative BOLD-CVR demonstrated a non-significant increase in BOLD-CVR values within the revascularized, symptomatic middle cerebral artery territory and cerebral hemisphere. The results of the statistical tests should be viewed as indicative due to the small sample size. Additionally, post-operative qMRA-NOVA revealed a significant improvement in the hemispheric volume flow rate of the affected hemisphere due to the additional bypass flow rate. Our findings affirm the presence of hemodynamic and flow impairments in the symptomatic hemisphere of the Moyamoya vasculopathy patients. Bypass surgery proves effective in improving both BOLD-CVR impairment and the hemispheric volume flow rate in our patient cohort.

AB  - Guided by a probe-based molecular networking strategy, five undescribed cycloheptapeptides, phakefusins A-E (1-5), were isolated from the marine sponge Phakellia fusca. Compounds 1 and 2 contain the nonproteinogenic amino acid residues of dioxindolyalanine (Dioia) and β-3-oxindolylalanine (Oia), respectively. Compound 3 possesses a unique methionine sulfoxide, whereas compound 5 includes a glutamic acid ethyl ester unit. Their structures were elucidated through NMR spectroscopy, HR-MS/MS analysis, and the advanced Marfey's method. By synthesizing the (S, S/R)-Oia standard through tryptophan oxidation, we determined the configuration of this amino acid in compound 2 using the advanced Marfey's method.

AB  - The ample peptide field is the best source for discovering clinically available novel antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to address emerging drug resistance. However, discovering novel AMPs is complex and expensive, representing a major challenge. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly improved the efficiency of identifying antimicrobial peptides from large libraries, whereas using random peptides as negative data increases the difficulty of discovering antimicrobial peptides from random peptides using discriminative models. In this study, we constructed three multi-discriminator models using deep learning and successfully screened twelve AMPs from a library of 30,000 random peptides. three candidate peptides (P2, P11, and P12) were screened by antimicrobial experiments, and further experiments showed that they not only possessed excellent antimicrobial activity but also had extremely low hemolytic activity. Mechanistic studies showed that these peptides exerted their bactericidal effects through membrane disruption, thus reducing the possibility of bacterial resistance. Notably, peptide 12 (P12) showed significant efficacy in a mouse model of Staphylococcus aureus wound infection with low toxicity to major organs at the highest tested dose (400 mg/kg). These results suggest deep learning-based multi-discriminator models can identify AMPs from random peptides with potential clinical applications.

AB  - While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are promising in the treatment of metastatic melanoma, about half of patients do not respond well to them. Low levels of human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) in tumors have been shown to negatively influence prognosis and response to ICIs. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is produced in large amounts by melanoma and is abundantly present in the tumor microenvironment. LPA induces the release of various cytokines and chemokines from tumor cells, which affect cancer development, metastasis, and tumor immunity. In the present study, we investigated the role of LPA-induced IL-10 release in regulating HLA-DR expression and the underlying mechanisms in human melanoma cells. We showed that LPA (0.001-10 μM) dose-dependently increased DR6 transcript levels through activating LPAR1 in HEK293T cells. Knockdown of NF-κB1 abrogated the LPA-increased DR6 expression without affecting basal DR6 expression in both A2058 and A375 melanoma cell lines. LPA (10 µM) significantly increased IL-10 transcripts in A2058 and A375 melanoma cells, the effect was abolished by pharmacological inhibition of LPAR1 or knockdown of DR6. We found a statistically significant correlation between the expression of LPAR1, DR6 and IL-10 in human melanoma tissue and an association between increased expression of LPAR1 and reduced effectiveness of ICI therapy. We demonstrated that LPA (10 µM) markedly suppressed HLA-DR expression in both A375 and A2058 melanoma cells via activating the LPAR1-DR6-IL-10 pathway. These data suggest that the LPAR1-DR6-IL-10 autocrine loop could constitute a novel mechanism used by tumor cells to evade immunosurveillance by decreasing HLA-DR expression.

AB  - The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of densely ionizing radiation can depend on the biological context. From a radiological perspective, age is an important factor affecting health risks of radiation exposure, but little is known about the modifying impact of age on the effects of densely ionizing radiation. Herein, we addressed the influence of age on leukemogenesis induced by accelerator-generated fast neutrons (mean energy, ∼2 MeV). Male C3H/HeNrs mice were exposed to 137Cs γ rays (0.2-3.0 Gy) or neutrons (0.0485-0.97 Gy, γ ray contamination 0.0105-0.21 Gy) at 1, 3, 8, or 35 weeks of age and observed over their lifetimes under specific pathogen-free conditions. Leukemia and lymphoma were diagnosed pathologically. Hazard ratio (HR) and RBE for myeloid leukemia mortality as well as the age dependence of these two parameters were modeled and analyzed using Cox regression. Neutron exposure increased HR concordant with a linear dose response. The increase of HR per dose depended on age at exposure, with no significant dose dependence at age 1 or 3 weeks but a significant increase in HR of 5.5 per Gy (γ rays) and 16 per Gy (neutrons) at 8 weeks and 5.8 per Gy (γ rays) and 9 per Gy (neutrons) at 35 weeks. The RBE of neutrons was 2.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.7), with no dependence on age. The development of lymphoid neoplasms was not related to radiation exposure. The observed increasing trend of radiation-associated mortality of myeloid leukemia with age at exposure supports previous epidemiological and experimental findings. The results also suggest that exposure at the susceptible age of 8 or 35 weeks does not significantly influence the RBE value for neutrons for induction of leukemia, unlike what has been documented for breast and brain tumors.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether there is a dose-dependent association between empiric dexamethasone and outcome in viral meningitis. METHODS: Observational cohort study of adults hospitalized for viral meningitis, both with and without a microbiologically confirmed diagnosis, in Denmark between 2015 and 2020. Dose-dependent associations between dexamethasone (one dose = 10 mg) and an unfavourable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score 1-4) at 30 days after discharge were assessed using weighted logistic regression. Entropy balancing was used to compute weights. RESULTS: Of 1025 included patients, 658 (64%) did not receive dexamethasone, 115 (11%) received 1-2 doses, 131 (13%) received 3-4 doses, and 121 (12%) received ≥5 doses. Among patients treated with dexamethasone, the median number of doses was higher for those without an identified pathogen than for those with a microbiologically confirmed viral aetiology (5 [interquartile range (IQR) 3-8] vs. 3 [IQR 2-5]; p < 0.001). Using no doses of dexamethasone as a reference, the weighted OR for an unfavourable outcome were 0.55 (95% CI, 0.29-1.07) for 1-2 doses, 1.13 (95% CI, 0.67-1.89) for 3-4 doses, and 1.43 (95% CI, 0.77-2.64) for ≥5 doses. In the subgroup of enteroviral meningitis, the weighted OR was 3.08 (95% CI, 1.36-6.94) for ≥5 doses, but decreased to 2.35 (95% CI, 0.65-8.40) when the reference group was restricted to patients treated with antibiotics for suspected bacterial meningitis. DISCUSSION: This study showed no dose-dependent association between dexamethasone and an unfavourable outcome in patients with viral meningitis. In enteroviral meningitis, ≥5 doses were associated with an increased risk of an unfavourable outcome. However, sensitivity analysis indicated that the association was affected by unmeasured or residual confounding by severity.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance has emerged as a significant threat to global public health. To develop novel, high efficiency antibacterial alternatives to combat multidrug-resistant bacteria, A total of thirty-two novel amphiphilic benzopyran derivatives by mimicking the structure and function of antimicrobial peptides were designed and synthesized. Among them, the most promising compounds 4h and 17e displayed excellent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (MICs = 1-4 μg/mL) with weak hemolytic activity and good membrane selectivity. Additionally, compounds 4h and 17e had rapid bactericidal properties, low resistance frequency, good plasma stability, and strong capabilities of inhibiting and eliminating bacterial biofilms. Mechanistic studies revealed that compounds 4h and 17e could effectively disrupt the integrity of bacterial cell membranes, and accompanied by an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species and the leakage of proteins and DNA, ultimately leading to bacterial death. Notably, compound 4h exhibited comparable in vivo antibacterial potency in a mouse septicemia model infected by Staphylococcus aureus ATCC43300, as compared to vancomycin. These findings indicated that 4h might be a promising antibacterial candidate to combat antimicrobial resistance.

AB  - The decline of antibiotics efficacy worldwide has recently reached a critical point urging for the development of new strategies to regain upper hand on multidrug resistant bacterial strains. In this context, the raise of photodynamic therapy (PDT), initially based on organic photosensitizers (PS) and more recently on organometallic PS, offers promising perspectives. Many PS exert their biological effects through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) able to freely diffuse into and to kill surrounding bacteria. Hijacking of the bacterial iron-uptake systems with siderophore-PS conjugates would specifically target pathogens. Here, we report the synthesis of unprecedented conjugates between the siderophore desferrioxamine B (DFOB) and an antibacterial iridium(III) PS. Redox properties of the new conjugates have been determined at excited states and compared to that of an antibacterial iridium PS previously reported by our groups. Tested on nosocomial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other bacteria, these conjugates demonstrated significant inhibitory activity when activated with blue LED light. Ir(III) conjugate and iridium free DFOB-2,2'-dipyridylamine ligands were crystallized in complex with FoxA, the outer membrane transporter involved in DFOB uptake in P. aeruginosa and revealed details of the binding mode of these unprecedented conjugates.

AB  - Influenza viruses that cause seasonal and pandemic flu are a permanent health threat. The surface glycoprotein, neuraminidase, is crucial for the infectivity of the virus and therefore an attractive target for flu drug discovery campaigns. We have designed and synthesized more than 40 3-indolinone derivatives. We mainly investigated the role of substituents at the 2 position of the core as well as the introduction of substituents or a nitrogen atom in the fused phenyl ring of the core for inhibition of influenza virus neuraminidase activity and replication in vitro and in vivo. After evaluating the compounds for their ability to inhibit the viral neuraminidase, six potent inhibitors 3c, 3e, 7c, 12o, 12v, 18d were progressed to evaluate for cytotoxicity and inhibition of influenza virus A/PR/8/34 replication in in MDCK cells. Two hit compounds 3e and 12o were tested in an animal model of influenza virus infection. Molecular mechanism of the 3-indolinone derivatives interactions with the neuraminidase was revealed in molecular dynamic simulations. Proposed inhibitors bind to the 430-cavity that is different from the conventional binding site of commercial compounds. The most promising 3-indolinone inhibitors demonstrate stronger interactions with the neuraminidase in molecular models that supports proposed binding site.

AB  - Papain-like protease (PLpro) is an attractive anti-coronavirus target. The development of PLpro inhibitors, however, is hampered by the limitations of the existing PLpro assay and the scarcity of validated active compounds. We developed a novel in-cell PLpro assay based on BRET and used it to evaluate and discover SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors. The developed assay demonstrated remarkable sensitivity for detecting the reduction of intracellular PLpro activity while presenting high reliability and performance for inhibitor evaluation and high-throughput screening. Using this assay, three protease inhibitors were identified as novel PLpro inhibitors that are structurally disparate from those previously known. Subsequent enzymatic assays and ligand-protein interaction analysis based on molecular docking revealed that ceritinib directly inhibited PLpro, showing high geometric complementarity with the substrate-binding pocket in PLpro, whereas CA-074 methyl ester underwent intracellular hydrolysis, exposing a free carboxyhydroxyl group essential for hydrogen bonding with G266 in the BL2 groove, resulting in PLpro inhibition.

AB  - Insects are attacked by a diverse range of microbial pathogens in the wild. In herbivorous species, larval host plants frequently play a critical role in mediating susceptibility to infection. Characterizing such plant-mediated effects on herbivore-pathogen interactions can provide insight into patterns of infection across wild populations. In this study, we investigated the effects of host plant use by two North American butterflies, Euphydryas phaeton (Nymphalidae) and Anartia jatrophae (Nymphalidae), on entomopathogen infection across a range of three doses. Both of these herbivores recently incorporated the same exotic plant, Plantago lanceolata (Plantaginaceae), into their host range and are naturally infected by the same entomopathogen, Junonia coenia densovirus (Parvoviridae), in wild populations. We performed two factorial experiments in which E. phaeton and A. jatrophae were reared on either P. lanceolata or a native host plant [Chelone glabra (Plantaginaceae) for E. phaeton; Bacopa monnieri (Plantaginaceae) for A. jatrophae] and inoculated with either a low, medium, or high dose of the virus. In E. phaeton, the outcomes of infection were highly dose-dependent, with inoculation with higher viral doses resulting in faster time to death and greater mortality. However, neither survival nor postmortem viral burdens varied depending upon the host plant that was consumed. In contrast, host plant use had a strong effect on viral burdens in A. jatrophae, with consumption of the exotic plant appearing to enhance host resistance to infection. Together, these results illustrate the variable influences of host plant use on herbivore resistance to infection, highlighting the importance of investigating plant-herbivore relationships within a tritrophic framework.

Antibacterial potential was checked against two Gram positive (B. subtilis and S. aureus) and two Gram negative (E. coli and P. aeruginosa) bacterial strains while antifungal potential was assayed against two fungal strains (C. albicans and A. niger). All the tested compounds showed satisfactory antibacterial potency in comparison to reference drug ciprofloxacin with MIC values ranging from 0.0108 to 0.0432 μmol/mL. Interestingly, except two, all the target compounds showed better antifungal property as compared to the reference drug fluconazole with MIC values less than 0.0408 μmol/mL. One of the compounds exhibited two-fold better antifungal potential in comparison to fluconazole. Furthermore, in-silico ADMET and DFT studies reported drug likeness behavior and chemical reactivity parameters, respectively. The cytotoxicity results on substrate azide 3 and most potent 1,2,3-triazoles (5 d and 5 l) were found to be non-toxic.

AB  - Influenza viruses (IV) are single-stranded RNA viruses with a negative-sense genome and have the potential to cause pandemics. While vaccines exist for influenza, their protection is only partial. Additionally, there is only a limited number of approved anti-IV drugs, which are associated to emergence of drug resistance. To address these issues, for years we have focused on the development of small-molecules that can interfere with the heterodimerization of PA and PB1 subunits of the IV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). In this study, starting from a cycloheptathiophene-3-carboxamide compound that we recently identified, we performed iterative cycles of medicinal chemistry optimization that led to the identification of compounds 43 and 45 with activity in the nanomolar range against circulating A and B strains of IV. Mechanistic studies demonstrated the ability of 43 and 45 to interfere with viral RdRP activity by disrupting PA-PB1 subunits heterodimerization and to bind to the PA C-terminal domain through biophysical assays. Most important, ADME studies of 45 also showed an improvement in the pharmacokinetic profile with respect to the starting hit.

AB  - Neuraminidase (NA) has been well-studied as a therapeutic target for Influenza. However, resistance to the influenza virus has been observed recently. Out of special interest in the utilization of dietary antivirals from citrus, in vitro inhibition activity against NA and in silico studies including molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulation, and a predictive ADMET study, were performed on five citrus-derived flavanones. Encouragingly, citrus-derived flavanones displayed comparable or even more potent in vitro inhibitory activity than oseltamivir carboxylate against NA. Orange peel extract exhibited higher activity than hesperidin. Among the tested compounds, neohesperidin, forming strong hydrogen-bonding interactions with key arginine residues, exhibited the most effective inhibitory activity against NAs from C. perfringens, consistent with the results of molecular dynamics simulations. Although the molecular docking results were inconsistent with the in vitro activity, the binding energy was identical against the wild-type and mutant, suggesting a lower likelihood of developing drug resistance. Moreover, predictive ADMET studies showed favorable pharmacokinetic properties for the tested compounds. Overall, citrus fruit peel emerges as a promising dietary supplement for prevention and treatment of influenza. These findings elucidate the impact of flavanones on NA activity, and the analysis of their binding modes provides valuable insights into the mechanism of NA inhibition.

AB  - Ensuring food safety, particularly for vulnerable groups, like infants and young children, requires identifying and prioritizing potential hazards in food chains. We previously developed a web-based decision support system (DSS) to identify specific microbiological hazards (MHs) in infant and toddler foods through a structured five-step process. This study takes the framework further by introducing systematic risk ranking (RR) steps to rank MH risks with seven criteria: process survival, recontamination, growth opportunity, meal preparation, hazard-food association evidence, food consumption habits of infants and toddlers in the EU, and MH severity. Each criterion is given a semi-quantitative or quantitative score or risk value, contributing to the final MH risk calculation via three aggregation methods: semi-quantitative risk scoring, semi-quantitative risk value, and outranking multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). To validate the criteria and ranking approaches, we conducted a case study to rank MH risks in infant formula, compared the results of the three risk ranking methods, and additionally evaluated the ranking results against expert opinions to ensure their accuracy. The results showed strong agreement among the three methods, consistently ranking Salmonella non-Typhi and Cronobacter spp. and Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli as the top MH risks in infant formulae, with minor deviations. When MHs were ranked after an initial hazard identification step, all three methods produced nearly identical MH rankings, reinforcing the reliability of the ranking steps and the selected criteria. Notably, the risk value and MCDA methods provided more informative MH rankings compared to the risk scoring method. The risk value and risk scoring methods were implemented into an online tool, called the MIcrobiological hazards risk RAnking decision support system (Mira-DSS), available at https://foodmicrobiologywur.shinyapps.io/MIcrobial_hazards_RAnking/. In conclusion, our framework enables the ranking of MH risks, facilitating intervention comparisons and resource allocations to mitigate MH risks in infant foods, with potential applicability to broader food categories.

AB  - Ketolides (3-keto) such as TE-802 and acylides (3-O-acyl) like TEA0929 are ineffective against constitutively resistant pathogens harboring erythromycin ribosomal methylation (erm) genes. Following our previous work on alkylides (3-O-alkyl), we explored the structure-activity relationships of hybrids combining (R/S) 3-descladinosyl erythromycin with 6/7-quinolone motifs, featuring extended ether-linked spacers, with a focus on their efficacy against pathogens bearing constitutive erm gene resistance. Optimized compounds 17a and 31f not only reinstated efficacy against inducibly resistant pathogens but also demonstrated significantly augmented activities against constitutively resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, which are typically refractory to existing C-3 modified macrolides. Notably, hybrid 31f (coded ZN-51) represented a pioneering class of agents distinguished by its dual modes of action, with ribosomes as the primary target and topoisomerases as the secondary target. As a novel chemotype of macrolide-quinolone hybrids, alkylide 31f is a valuable addition to our armamentarium against macrolide-resistant bacteria.

AB  - Many studies have demonstrated that long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) targeting essential genes of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) can induce a sequence-specific antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) response in shrimp, thereby offering protection against WSSV infection. However, further experimental data on the required dose of dsRNAs and the duration of protection from a single administration are necessary to establish RNAi-mediated methods as effective and practical antiviral measures. In this study, we evaluated the protective efficacy and the duration of protection provided by a single administration of various doses of long dsRNA targeting WSSV ribonucleotide reductase 2 (rr2) in white-leg shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. The protective efficacy of long dsRNA targeting WSSV rr2 was not diminished by the reduction of the dose to 100 ng g-1 of body weight, suggesting that a relatively low dose can effectively induce an RNAi response in shrimp. Furthermore, shrimp were well-protected against WSSV challenges for up to 4 wk post-administration of the rr2-targeting long dsRNA, although the protective effect almost disappeared at 6 wk post-administration. These results suggest that long dsRNAs can provide protection against WSSV for at least 1 mo, and monthly administration of long dsRNAs could serve as a long-term protective strategy for shrimp against WSSV.

AB  - Endometritis is the leading cause of mare subfertility. Most mares respond to standard therapy, but alternative therapies have been developed for mares failing to respond. This study aimed to investigate a commercially available, yet unassessed, product labeled as a uterine sanitizer to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity against microorganisms associated with endometritis and its in vitro stability to dilute antibiotics. In experiment 1, the microdilution broth technique and antimicrobial effects were assessed against Escherichia sp, Staphylococcus sp., Klebsiella sp., Pseudomonas sp., and Candida sp. Percentage inhibition was calculated by comparing the optical density. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 100% was determined using the resazurin dye technique. MIC 50% and 90% were determined using a dose-response non-linear regression. In experiment 2, the uterine sanitizer was used to dilute commonly used antibiotics achieving a final volume of 90 mL at 5°C, 21°C, and 37°C. The pH was measured at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 24 h after dilution. The uterine sanitizer had inhibitory properties against all microorganisms; Escherichia sp. being the most susceptible, and Pseudomonas sp. the most resistant. The uterine sanitizer had an acidic pH=4; however, when combined with the antibiotics, the pH of the antibiotic remained unchanged with the different temperatures and did not precipitate. In conclusion, the uterine sanitizer showed antimicrobial effects against endometritis-causing microorganisms. The dilution of antibiotics in the uterine sanitizer was stable and this association could potentiate the antimicrobial effects. Uterine sanitizer's safety and clinical efficacy in vivo remain to be tested.

AB  - Mycetoma is a neglected invasive infection endemic in tropical and subtropical regions, presenting as a chronic subcutaneous inflammatory mass that can spread to deeper structures, leading to deformities, disabilities, and potentially mortality. The current treatment of eumycetoma, the fungal form of mycetoma, involves antifungal agents, such as itraconazole, combined with surgical intervention. However, this approach has limited success, with low cure rates and a high risk of recurrence. This study addresses to the urgent need for more effective therapeutics by designing and synthesising 47 diversely pharmacomodulated imidazo [1,2-b]pyridazine derivatives using a simple synthetic pathway with good yields and purity. Of these, 17 showed promising in vitro activity against Madurella mycetomatis, the prime causative agent of eumycetoma, with IC

AB  - Natural products received much attention as an environmentally beneficial solution for pest management. Therefore, the extracts of invasive silverleaf nightshade (Solanum elaeagnifolium Cav.) weeds using their berries parts (seeds, peels and mucilage) supported by bioassay-guided fractionation were tested against both the greater wax moth (Galleria mellonella) and Erwinia carotovora pv. carotovora causes of the blackleg of potatoes. The seeds and peels of S. elaeagnifolium were successively extracted by maceration using dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), and ethanol (EtOH), respectively. While, its mucilage was extracted using EtOAc. The successive EtOH extract of the plant seeds had promising inhibition efficacy and the best minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) of 50 µg/ml against E. Carotovora amongst other extracts (DCM and EtOAc of the plant berries parts). Depending on dose response activity, EtOH extract had G. mellonella larval mortality and pupal duration rates (LC

AB  - The increasing prevalence of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains stimulates the discovery of new drug candidates. Among them are 8-hydroxyquinoline (8HQ) derivatives that exhibited antimicrobial properties. Unfortunately, there is a lack of data assessing possible targets for this class mainly against Mycobacterium tuberculosis enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (MtInhA), a validated target in this field. Thus, the main purpose of this study was to identify 8HQ derivatives that are active against M. tuberculosis and MtInhA. Initially, the screening against the microorganism of a small antimicrobial library and its new derivatives that possess some structural similarity with MtInhA inhibitors identified four 7-substituted-8HQ (series 5 - 5a, 5c, 5d and 5i) and four 5-substituted-8HQ active derivatives (series 7 - 7a, 7c, 7d and 7j). In general, the 7-substituted 8-HQs were more potent and, in the enzymatic assay, were able to inhibit MtInhA at low micromolar range. However, the 5-substituted-8-HQs that presented antimycobacterial activity were not able to inhibit MtInhA. These findings indicate the non-promiscuous nature of 8-HQ derivatives and emphasize the significance of selecting appropriate substituents to achieve in vitro enzyme inhibition. Finally, 7-substituted-8HQ series are promising new derivatives for structure-based drug design and further development.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study, we have synthesized 19 Thiazolidine (TZD) derivatives to investigate their potential anti-ZIKV effects. METHODS: Nineteen thiazolidine derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their cytotoxicity and antiviral activity against the ZIKA virus. RESULTS: Among them, six demonstrated remarkable selectivity against the ZIKV virus, exhibiting IC50 values of <5μM, and the other compounds did not demonstrate selectivity for the virus. Interestingly, several derivatives effectively suppressed the replication of ZIKV RNA copies, with derivatives significantly reducing ZIKV mRNA levels at 24 hours post-infection (hpi). Notably, two derivatives (ZKC-4 and -9) stood out by demonstrating a protective effect against ZIKV cell entry. Informed by computational analysis of binding affinity and intermolecular interactions within the NS5 domain's N-7 and O'2 positions, ZKC-4 and FT-39 displayed the highest predicted affinities. Intriguingly, ZKC-4 and ZKC-9 derivatives exhibited the most favorable predicted binding affinities for the ZIKV-E binding site. CONCLUSION: The significance of TZDs as potent antiviral agents is underscored by these findings, suggesting that exploring TZD derivatives holds promise for advancing antiviral therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Mycoplasma synoviae (MS) infection is a serious threat to poultry industry in China. Tilmicosin is a semisynthetic macrolide antibiotic used only in animals and has shown potential efficacy against MS, but there were no reported articles concerning the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) interactions of tilmicosin against MS in vitro and vivo. This study aimed to assess the antibacterial activity of tilmicosin against MS in vitro and in vivo using PK/PD model to provide maximal efficacy. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and killing rates of different drug concentrations were measured using the microdilution method in vitro. Then, tilmicosin was administered orally to the MS-infected chickens at doses of 7.5 and 60 mg/kg, and the PK parameters of tilmicosin in joint dialysates were determined using high-pressure liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) combined with the microdialysis technique. The antibacterial effect (△E) was calculated when the infected chickens were administered a single oral dose of tilmicosin at 4, 7.5, 15, 30, and 60 mg/kg b.w. The PK and PD data were fitted using the Sigmoid E

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass is classically considered a low-flow bypass. It is known that the flow in the flow augmentation STA-MCA bypass is influenced by flow demand of the revascularized territory and can reach significantly higher values. The authors report their intraoperative flow measurement data in a consecutive series of 100 STA-MCA bypasses performed at their institution. Moreover, in a subanalysis, they show the postoperative bypass flow measured with quantitative MR angiography (qMRA) noninvasive optimal vessel analysis (NOVA). METHODS: Between January 2013 and October 2023, 100 patients with acute, subacute, or chronic large-vessel occlusion (LVO) or moyamoya disease underwent a flow augmentation STA-MCA bypass revascularization at the authors' department with intraoperative bypass flow measurement. Patients with atherosclerotic LVO who underwent bypass surgery within a 6-week period following the onset of ischemic stroke symptoms were categorized into the acute bypass group, encompassing both acute and subacute LVO cases. Conversely, those who underwent bypass surgery > 6 weeks after the last occurrence of ischemic stroke were classified as the chronic group. Since May 2019, a consecutive subgroup of 37 patients received a postoperative (before discharge) bypass flow measurement with the qMRA-NOVA imaging tool. RESULTS: The mean ± SD intraoperative bypass flow in this consecutive series of 100 STA-MCA bypasses was 53.5 ± 28.8 ml/min (range 14-145 ml/min). In the subanalysis, there was no difference in the intraoperative flow capacity between the acute and chronic groups and between the moyamoya and acute groups. Patients in the moyamoya group showed a significantly higher flow rate in the STA-MCA bypass compared with the chronic group (63.0 ± 30.2 ml/min vs 48.4 ± 26.5 ml/min, p = 0.03). In a consecutive subanalysis of 37 STA-MCA bypass cases, postoperative flow measurements were also performed using qMRA-NOVA, showing a significant increase in the flow of STA-MCA bypasses after surgery compared with intraoperative flow measurements (mean intraoperative bypass flow rate vs qMRA-NOVA postoperative bypass flow rate: 73.4 ± 29.9 ml/min vs 111.3 ± 51.4 ml/min, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Using intraoperative and postoperative quantitative flow measurements of the STA, the data confirm that the flow in the flow augmentation STA-MCA bypass is influenced by the flow demand of the revascularized territory and can reach high values if needed. Moreover, the significant flow increase in the postoperative flow measurement using qMRA-NOVA demonstrates that the bypass can increase its flow over time.

AB  - Although classical molecular biology assays can provide a measure of cellular response to chemical challenges, they rely on a single biological phenomenon to infer a broader measure of cellular metabolic response. These methods do not always afford the necessary sensitivity to answer questions of subcytotoxic effects, nor do they work for all cell types. Likewise, boutique assays such as cardiomyocyte beat rate may indirectly measure cellular metabolic response, but they too, are limited to measuring a specific biological phenomenon and are often limited to a single cell type. For these reasons, toxicological researchers need new approaches to determine metabolic changes across various doses in differing cell types, especially within the low-dose regime. The data collected herein demonstrate that LC-MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomics with a feature-agnostic view of the data, combined with a suite of statistical methods including an adapted environmental threshold analysis, provides a versatile, robust, and holistic approach to directly monitoring the overall cellular metabolomic response to pesticides. When employing this method in investigating two different cell types, human cardiomyocytes and neurons, this approach revealed separate subcytotoxic metabolomic responses at doses of 0.1 and 1 µM of chlorpyrifos and carbaryl. These findings suggest that this agnostic approach to untargeted metabolomics can provide a new tool for determining effective dose by metabolomics of chemical challenges, such as pesticides, in a direct measurement of metabolomic response that is not cell type-specific or observable using traditional assays.

AB  - In response to the escalating threat of microbial resistance, a series of novel pleuromutilin derivatives, conjugated with phenyl-sulfide and boron-containing moieties, were designed and synthesized. Most derivatives, especially 14b and 16b, demonstrated significant efficacy against Gram-positive bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains, as well as pleuromutilin-resistant strains. Compound 16b showed high stability in the liver microsomes of rats and humans, along with acceptable tolerance in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, compound 16b exhibited promising efficacy in MRSA-infected mouse models. Our data highlight the potential of conjugated pleuromutilin derivatives as valuable agents against drug-resistant bacteria.

In response to the increasing bacterial resistance, we integrated the quaternary amine structure into the design of ruthenium complexes and evaluated their antibacterial activity. All the ruthenium complexes showed good antibacterial activity against the tested Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Ru-8 was the most effective antibacterial agent that displayed excellent antibacterial activity against S. aureus (MIC = 0.78-1.56 μg/mL). In vitro experiments showed that all nine ruthenium complexes had low hemolytic toxicity to rabbit erythrocytes. Notably, Ru-8 was found to disrupt bacterial cell membranes, alter their permeability, and induce ROS production in bacteria, all the above leading to the death of bacteria without inducing drug resistance. To further explore the antibacterial activity of Ru-8in vivo, we established a mouse skin wound infection model and a G. mellonella larvae infection model. Ru-8 exhibited significant antibacterial efficacy against S. aureus in vivo and low toxicity to mouse tissues. The Ru-8 showed low toxicity to Raw264.7 cells (mouse monocyte macrophage leukemia cells). This study indicates that the ruthenium complex ruthenium quaternary was a promising strategy for the development of new antibacterial agents.

AB  - Concerns are rising about the contamination of recreational waters from human and animal waste, along with associated risks to public health. However, existing guidelines for managing pathogens in these environments have not yet fully integrated risk-based pathogen-specific criteria, which, along with recent advancements in indicators and markers, are essential to improve the protection of public health. This study aimed to establish risk-based critical concentration benchmarks for significant enteric pathogens, i.e., norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus, Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia lamblia, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella spp., and Escherichia coli O157:H7. Applying a 0.036 risk benchmark to both marine and freshwater environments, the study identified the lowest critical concentrations for children, who are the most susceptible group. Norovirus, C. jejuni, and Cryptosporidium presented lowest median critical concentrations for virus, bacteria, and protozoa, respectively: 0.74 GC, 1.73 CFU, and 0.39 viable oocysts per 100 mL in freshwater for children. These values were then used to determine minimum sample volumes corresponding to different recovery rates for culture method, digital polymerase chain reaction and quantitative PCR methods. The results indicate that for children, norovirus required the largest sample volumes of freshwater and marine water (52.08 to 178.57 L, based on the 5th percentile with a 10 % recovery rate), reflecting its low critical concentration and high potential for causing illness. In contrast, adenovirus and rotavirus required significantly smaller volumes (approximately 0.24 to 1.33 L). C. jejuni and Cryptosporidium, which required the highest sampling volumes for bacteria and protozoa, needed 1.72 to 11.09 L and 4.17 to 25.51 L, respectively. Additionally, the presented risk-based framework could provide a model for establishing pathogen thresholds, potentially guiding the creation of extensive risk-based criteria for various pathogens in recreational waters, thus aiding public health authorities in decision-making, strengthening pathogen monitoring, and improving water quality testing accuracy for enhanced health protection.

AB  - The escalating severity of the menace posed by bacterial resistance has rendered the existing antibiotics less effective, thus necessitating the discovery of new antibacterial agents. The current study reports the exploration of substituted N-pyridinylaminonaphthols produced by a straightforward, one-pot multicomponent reaction process as antibacterial agents. The synthesized derivatives were assessed in vitro for their antibacterial properties against a panel of bacterial pathogens. The analogs 4b, 4g, 4h, 4i, 4j, 4l, 4r, and 4t exhibited potent inhibitory activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 1-2 µg/mL. Notably, 4b, 4l, and 4t displayed an excellent selectivity index. Additionally, they were active against the multidrug-resistant bacterial strains, with 4l exhibiting the best activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin resistant staphylococcus aureus with a MIC of 1 µg/mL. 4l showed synergism with gentamycin and showed bactericidal property in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the molecule 4l inhibited the DNA gyrase supercoiling activity. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion/toxicity parameters and pharmacokinetic properties were assessed via in silico techniques, which elucidate the potential mode of action. These findings demonstrate the potential of the N-pyridinylaminonaphthol derivatives as antibacterial agents against multidrug-resistant S. aureus.

AB  - Influenza viruses are susceptible to seasonal influenza, which has repeatedly caused global pandemics and jeopardized human health. Vaccines are only used as preventive medicine due to the extreme mutability of influenza viruses, and antiviral medication is the most significant clinical treatment to reduce influenza morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, the clinical application of anti-influenza virus agents is characterized by the narrow therapeutic time window, the susceptibility to drug resistance, and relatively limited effect on severe influenza. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop novel anti-influenza virus drugs to fulfill the urgent clinical needs. Influenza viruses enter host cells through the hemagglutinin (HA) mediated membrane fusion process, and fusion inhibitors function antivirally by blocking hemagglutinin deformation, promising better therapeutic efficacy and resolving drug resistance, with targets different from marketed medicines. Previous studies have shown that unnatural peptides derived from Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) membrane fusion proteins exhibit anti-HIV-1 activity. Based on the similarity of the membrane fusion protein deformation process between HIV-1 and H1N1, we selected sequences derived from the gp41 subunit in the HIV-1 fusion protein, and then constructed N-trimer spatial structure through inter-helical isopeptide bond modification, to design the novel anti-H1N1 fusion inhibitors. The results showed that the novel peptides could block 6-HB formation during H1N1 membrane fusion procedure, and thus possessed significant anti-H1N1 activity, comparable to the positive control oseltamivir. Our study demonstrates the design viability of peptide fusion inhibitors based on similar membrane fusion processes among viruses, and furthermore provides an important idea for the novel anti-H1N1 inhibitors development.

AB  - Xanthobacter sp. SoF1 (SoF1) is an autotrophic hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria that produces protein-rich biomass and has potential to be an alternative protein source that is more environmentally sustainable than animal and plant derived proteins. A protein-rich powder derived from SoF1 was the test material in a 90-day repeated-dose oral toxicity study to explore major toxic effects, demonstrate target organs, and provide an estimate of a no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL). Daily doses of 0 (vehicle only), 375, 750, and 1500 mg/kg bw/day of the test material were administered by gavage to 10 Han:WIST rats/sex/group. An additional group was administered 1290 mg/kg bw/day whey protein concentrate as positive control. No treatment-related adverse effects were observed, and no target organs were determined after 90/91 days of consecutive administration of the test item. A NOAEL of 1500 mg/kg bw/day was determined.

AB  - A bioassay-guided isolation from Atractylodes lancea (Thunb.)

This study evaluated their antibacterial activity against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) for the first time, as well as anti-inflammatory activity. Most of them, including new compounds, showed varying degrees of antibacterial activity against S. aureus and MRSA. Notably, compound 21 exhibited significant antibacterial activity against four different bacteria (MIC 6.25-20.00 μg/mL). This suggested that 21 may have the potential to be developed into a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent. Moreover, except for 9 and 11, most compounds exhibited great anti-inflammatory activity (IC

AB  - The abuse of antibiotics leads to the rapid spread of bacterial resistance, which seriously threatens human life and health. Now, 8 resorcylic acid derivatives, including 4 new compounds (1-4) were isolated from Lysimachia tengyuehensis by bio-guided isolation, and they inhibited both methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) (MIC = 4-8 μg/mL). Notably, 1 and 2 rapidly killed MRSA and VRE within 40 min without drug resistance in 20 days. Mechanically, they potently disrupted biofilm and cell membrane by interfering with bacterial metabolic imbalance. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) revealed that the lipophilic long carbon chains (C-5/C-6) and hydrophilic hydroxyl/carboxyl groups were essential for the anti-MRSA and VRE bioactivity. Additionally, they effectively recovered MRSA-infected skin wounds and VRE-infected peritoneal in vivo. Resorcylic acid derivatives showed significant anti-MRSA and VRE bioactivity in vitro and in vivo with potential application for the first time.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hormesis describes an inverse dose-response relationship, whereby a high dose of a toxic compound is inhibitory, and a low dose is stimulatory. This study explores the hormetic response of low concentrations of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) toward Pseudomonas aeruginosa. METHOD: Samples of P. aeruginosa, i.e. the reference strain, ATCC 27,853, together with six strains recovered from patients with cystic fibrosis, were exposed to ten decreasing ZnO NPs doses (0.78-400 µg/mL). The ZnO NPs were manufactured from Peganum harmala using a chemical green synthesis approach, and their properties were verified utilizing X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. A microtiter plate technique was employed to investigate the impact of ZnO NPs on the growth, biofilm formation and metabolic activity of P. aeruginosa. Real-time polymerase chain reactions were performed to determine the effect of ZnO NPs on the expression of seven biofilm-encoding genes. RESULT: The ZnO NPs demonstrated concentration-dependent bactericidal and antibiofilm efficiency at concentrations of 100-400 µg/mL. However, growth was significantly stimulated at ZnO NPs concentration of 25 µg/mL (ATCC 27853, Pa 3 and Pa 4) and at 12.5 µg/mL and 6.25 µg/mL (ATCC 27853, Pa 2, Pa 4 and Pa 5). No significant positive growth was detected at dilutions < 6.25 µg/mL. similarly, biofilm formation was stimulated at concentration of 12.5 µg/mL (ATCC 27853 and Pa 1) and at 6.25 µg/mL (Pa 4). At concentration of 12.5 µg/mL, ZnO NPs upregulated the expression of LasB ( ATCC 27853, Pa 1 and Pa 4) and LasR and LasI (ATCC 27853 and Pa 1) as well as RhII expression (ATCC 27853, Pa 2 and Pa 4). CONCLUSION: When exposed to low ZnO NPs concentrations, P. aeruginosa behaves in a hormetic manner, undergoing positive growth and biofilm formation. These results highlight the importance of understanding the response of P. aeruginosa following exposure to low ZnO NPs concentrations.

Here, we report the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag- NPs) employing garlic essential oil (GEO) due to wide applications of GEO in the biomedical and pharmaceutical industry. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to synthesise garlic essential oil-assisted silver nanoparticles and present their antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities with mechanistic assessment. METHOD: Initially, the formulation of AgNPs was confirmed using different optical techniques, such as XRD, FT-IR, DLS, zeta potential, SEM, and EDX analysis, which confirmed the formulation of well-dispersed, stable, and spherical AgNPs. The antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity of GEO-assisted AgNPs was evaluated against a spectrum of pathogenic microorganisms, such as Gram-positive ( RESULTS: The AgNPs exhibited remarkable antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity against all tested strains. The mechanism behind the antimicrobial activity of AgNPs was explored by estimating the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated due to the interaction of AgNP with bacterial cells and observing the morphological changes of bacteria upon AgNP interaction. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study concluded that ROS generation due to the interaction of AgNPs with bacterial cells put stress on bacterial membranes, altering the morphology of bacteria, exhibiting remarkable antimicrobial activity, and preventing biofilm formation.

AB  - The enterovirus is a genus of single-stranded, highly diverse positive-sense RNA viruses, including Human Enterovirus A-D and Human Rhinovirus A-C species. They are responsible for numerous diseases and some infections can progress to life-threatening complications, particularly in children or immunocompromised patients. To date, there is no treatment against enteroviruses on the market, except for polioviruses (vaccine) and EV-A71 (vaccine in China). Following a decrease in enterovirus infections during and shortly after the (SARS-Cov2) lockdown, enterovirus outbreaks were once again detected, notably in young children. This reemergence highlights on the need to develop broad-spectrum treatment against enteroviruses. Over the last year, our research team has identified a new class of small-molecule inhibitors showing anti-EV activity. Targeting the well-known hydrophobic pocket in the viral capsid, these compounds show micromolar activity against EV-A71 and a high selectivity index (SI) (5h: EC

AB  - In the current study, to discover novel antibacterial agents, we designed and synthesized 72 carvacrol and thymol derivatives by biomimicking the structure and function of cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Many of the derivatives showed good antibacterial activity, and compound thy2I exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 0.5 μg/mL to 8 μg/mL. Compound thy2I could kill both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria via a membrane-targeting mechanism of action with a low frequency of resistance. In addition, thy2I had the advantages of good membrane selectivity, low toxicity in vitro and in vivo, and good plasma stability. The in vivo activity results revealed that thy2I exhibited a positive therapeutic effect in a mouse skin abscess model induced by Staphylococcus aureus ATCC29213. After thy2I treatment (10 mg/kg), the bacterial load of the S. aureus-infected abscesses was reduced by approximately 99.65 %. Our study suggests that thy2I may serve as an antibacterial lead for further clinical evaluation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although infections play a role in the development of lung cancer, the longitudinal association between infection and the risk of lung cancer is disputed, and data relating to pathogen types and infection sites are sparse. RESEARCH QUESTION: How do infections affect subsequent lung cancer risk, and is the impact limited to specific microbes rather than infection burden? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data on > 900 infectious diseases were gathered from the UK Biobank study. Short- and long-term effects of infections were assessed by using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models. The analysis was repeated, excluding patients with concurrent multi-pathogen infections or outcomes within the 10 years following the initial hospitalization for the index infection. A life table approach was used to estimate years of life lost from lung cancer. Infection burden was defined as the sum of the number of infection episodes over time and co-occurring infections. The genome-wide association studies used in two-sample Mendelian randomization were obtained from mostly European ancestry. RESULTS: Hospital-treated infectious disease was associated with a greater risk of lung cancer (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.79; 95% CI, 1.74-1.83). aHRs for lung cancer ranged from 1.39 to 2.82 across pathogen types. The impact of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) on lung cancer was the strongest, with an aHR of 3.22 (95% CI, 2.64-3.92); the aHR for extra-LRTIs was 1.29 (95% CI, 1.16-1.44). A dose-response association was observed between infection burden and lung cancer risk across different FEV INTERPRETATION: Both observational and genetic analyses suggest that infectious diseases could increase the risk of lung cancer. The dual perspective on the LRTIs and extra-LRTIs impacts may inform lung cancer prevention strategies.

AB  - The study aimed to assess the effects of different dietary Silybum marianum (SM, milk thistle) powder levels on growth performance, productivity, immunity, small intestine, haemato-biochemical parameters, meat quality, and egg and carcass characteristics of laying quails. The experimental subjects consisted of one hundred and eight 43-day-old quails divided into 3 treatments (0, 0.75, and 1.50% SM) with 4 replicates each. The egg characteristics and growth performance of the quails were evaluated. Quails were euthanized for evaluation of carcasses, microbiota, and sensory characteristics of meat. Blood samples were analyzed for haematology and biochemical profile. SM at 0.75% and 1.50% significantly (P < 0.05) increased feed intake, enhanced egg characteristics (number, weight, width, length, volume, weight of egg yolk, and eggshell thickness), jejunum and ileum length, spleen weight, lactobacillus population, sensory characteristics of meat, red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin, erythrocytic indices, concentration of albumin, globulin and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). SM at 0.75% and 1.50% decreased (P < 0.05) carcass weight (abdominal fat, heart, neck, and pancreas), feed conversion ratio (FCR) based on eggs produced, percentages of heterophils and lymphocytes, concentration of lactate dehydrogenase, population of coliforms clostridia, and Escherichia coli. Aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and creatine kinase were not significantly (P > 0.05) altered by 0.75% and 1.50% SM. SM at both levels (0.75% and 1.50%) may improve growth, egg characteristics, immune response, intestinal morphology and microbiota, meat quality and erythropoiesis, and also lead to decreased cholesterol in laying quails. Economics can be improved, too. The authors recommend adding 1.0% of SM to quail diet.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Daptomycin is a high-use intravenous antimicrobial agent affording the convenience of once-daily dosing. Prior studies suggest an opportunity to use a more operationally convenient fixed rather than weight-based dosing but this approach has not been studied prospectively. METHODS: This study quantified the probability of toxicity and efficacy end points by prospectively testing a fixed dose regimen of daptomycin (750 mg) in obese and non-obese adults. At least, three daptomycin concentrations were measured at steady-state for each patient. A population pharmacokinetic model was constructed to evaluate concentration-time profiles and investigate covariates of daptomycin clearance. Simulations were performed to evaluate the probability of achieving efficacy (24-h area under the curve (AUC RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (16 females, 15 males) with median (interquartile range (IQR)) age of 50 (30, 62) years and weight of 74 (54, 156) kg were included in the final analysis. Fixed dose daptomycin (750 mg) resulted in similar exposure across weights with a median (IQR) AUC CONCLUSIONS: Fixed daptomycin dosing adjusted for sex and kidney function is expected to improve the efficacy-to-toxicity ratio, transitions of care, and costs compared to weight-based doses. However, no empiric dosing approach is predicted to achieve ≥90% efficacy while minimizing the risk of toxicity, so therapeutic drug monitoring should be considered on a patient-specific basis.

AB  - CONTEXT: Phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln) is a novel metabolite derived from gut microbial metabolism of dietary proteins, specifically phenylalanine, which may be linked to risks of adverse cardiovascular events. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether higher plasma levels of PAGln were associated with a greater risk of incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and tested whether adherence to a plant-based diet, which characterizes habitual dietary patterns of animal and plant food intake, modified the associations. METHODS: We examined associations between plasma PAGln and risk of incident CHD over 11 to 16 years in a nested case-control study of 1520 women (760 incident cases and 760 controls) from the Nurses' Health Study. Separately, we analyzed relations between PAGln and dietary intakes measured through dietary records in the Women's Lifestyle Validation Study (n = 725). RESULTS: Higher PAGln levels were related to a greater risk of CHD (P < .05 for dose-response relationship). Higher PAGln was associated with greater red/processed meat intake and lower vegetable intake (P < .05 for all). We found a significant interaction between PAGln and adherence to plant-based diet index (PDI) on CHD (Pinteraction = .008); higher PAGln levels were associated with an increased risk of CHD (relative risk per 1 SD: 1.22 [95% CI: 1.05, 1.41]) among women with low PDI but not among those with high PDI. CONCLUSION: Higher PAGln was associated with higher risk of CHD, particularly in women with dietary patterns of eating more animal foods and fewer plant-based foods. Adherence to plant-based diets might attenuate unfavorable associations between a novel microbial metabolite and CHD risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rift Valley fever virus, a pathogen to ruminants, camelids, and humans, is an emerging mosquito-borne bunyavirus currently endemic to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Although animals are primarily infected via mosquito bites, humans mainly become infected following contact with infected tissues or fluids of infected animals. There is an urgent need for adequate countermeasures, especially for humans, because effective therapeutics or vaccines are not yet available. Here we assessed the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a next-generation, four-segmented, live-attenuated vaccine candidate, referred to as hRVFV-4s, in humans. METHODS: A first-in-human, single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was done in Belgium in which a single dose of hRVFV-4s was administered to healthy volunteers aged 18-45 years. Participants were randomly assigned using an interactive web response system. The study population encompassed 75 participants naive to Rift Valley fever virus infection, divided over three dosage groups (cohorts) of 25 participants each. All participants were followed up until 6 months. Using a staggered dose escalating approach, 20 individuals of each cohort were injected in the deltoid muscle of the non-dominant arm with either 10 FINDINGS: Between August and December, 2022, all 75 participants were vaccinated. No serious adverse events or vaccine-related severe adverse events were reported. Pain at the injection site (51 [85%] of 60 participants) was most frequently reported as solicited local adverse event, and headache (28 [47%] of 60) and fatigue (28 [47%] of 60) as solicited systemic adverse events in the active group. No vaccine virus RNA was detected in any of the blood, saliva, urine, or semen samples. Rift Valley fever virus nucleocapsid antibody responses were detected in most participants who were vaccinated with hRVFV-4s (43 [72%] of 60 on day 14) irrespective of the administered dose. In contrast, a clear dose-response relationship was observed for neutralising antibodies on day 28 with four (20%) of 20 participants responding in the low-dose group, 13 (65%) of 20 responding in the medium-dose group, and all participants (20 [100%] of 20) responding in the high-dose group. Consistent with the antibody responses, cellular immune responses against the nucleocapsid protein were detected in all dose groups, whereas a more dose-dependent response was observed for the Gn and Gc surface glycoproteins. Neutralising antibody titres declined over time, whereas nucleocapsid antibody responses remained relatively stable for at least 6 months. INTERPRETATION: The hRVFV-4s vaccine showed a high safety profile and excellent tolerability across all tested dose regimens, eliciting robust immune responses, particularly with the high-dose administration. The findings strongly support further clinical development of this candidate vaccine for human use.

AB  - Bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV inhibition has emerged as a promising strategy for the cure of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The Novel Bacterial Topoisomerase Inhibitors (NBTIs) bind to a different site from that of the quinolones with novel mechanism of action. This evades the existing target-mediated bacterial resistance associated with quinolones. This article presents our efforts to identify in vitro potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial agent 4l.

AB  - A series of novel sulfonamide and acetamide derivatives of pyrimidine were synthesized and their antimicrobial activities were assessed. Based on the Microbroth dilution method, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the synthesized compounds demonstrated moderate to good levels of antifungal and antibacterial activity. Structure-activity relationship analysis suggested that the presence of electron-withdrawing groups, such as halogens, nitrile, and nitro groups, on the pyrimidine ring contributed to the enhanced antimicrobial potency, while electron-donating substituents led to a decrease in activity. Computational studies, including density functional theory (DFT), frontier molecular orbitals (FMO), and molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) analysis, provided insights into the electronic properties and charge distribution of the compounds. Drug-likeness evaluation using ADME/Tox analysis indicated that the synthesized compounds possess favorable physicochemical properties and could be potential drug candidates. Molecular docking against the Mycobacterium TB protein tyrosine phosphatase B (MtbPtpB) revealed that the synthesized compounds exhibited strong binding affinities (-46 kcal/mol to - 61 kcal/mol) and formed stable protein-ligand complexes through hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking interactions with key residues in the active site. The observed interactions from the docking simulations were consistent with the predicted interaction sites identified in the FMO and MEP analyses. These findings suggest that the synthesized pyrimidine derivatives could serve as promising antimicrobial agents and warrant further investigation for drug development.

AB  - The rise of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has extended the duration of tuberculosis (TB) treatment and reduced the likelihood of cure. One strategy to combat this issue is the development of inhibitors targeting the virulence factors of bacterial pathogens. Mtb' catalase (KatG) is crucial for its detoxification mechanisms and also serves as a significant virulence factor for the bacterium. In this study, twelve derivatives synthesized from 5-fluoropyridine and benzo[b]thiophene demonstrated antimycobacterial efficacy with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) varying between 0.5 and 32 μg/mL. Compound 2, 1-(benzo[b]thiophen-2-ylmethylene) thiosemicarbazide, emerged as the most potent candidate. It effectively inhibited Mtb KatG, enhanced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Mtb, and achieved Mtb killing within 96 hours at a concentration of 2 μg/mL (4×MIC). Molecular docking simulations revealed that compound 2 binds tightly to the active site of Mtb-KatG with a docking score of 114, indicating that it may serve as a potent inhibitor of Mtb-KatG. The rabbit skin tuberculosis model was employed to assess the virulence of Mtb. Animal study results indicated that the granulomas induced by Mtb after treatment with compound 2 were reduced in size, exhibited a lower bacterial load, and the bacteria were no longer aggregated, in contrast to those caused by untreated Mtb. Hence, compound 2 can be regarded as a molecule capable of neutralizing the virulence factors of Mtb. This research offers insights into the design of anti-Mtb molecules with novel mechanisms of action.

Model input parameters were sourced from the scientific literature and experimental data. The availability of data was diverse across input parameters, and especially parameters on the aerosolization of fecal droppings, survival of HPAIv and dispersal of aerosols were uncertain. Model results indicated that the daily probability of infection of a single poultry farm is very low, with a median value of 7.5 × 10

AB  - Overexposure of sewage workers to bioaerosol released from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) can cause serious infections, but practical method for controlling their health risk is lacking. In this study, reverse quantitative microbial risk assessment was used to estimate the daily critical exposure time (CET) of sewage workers exposing to Staphylococcus aureus bioaerosol emitted by three emission sources facilities in a WWTP based on either U.S. EPA or WHO benchmark, and sensitivity analysis was conducted to analyze the influence of various parameters on the outcomes of CET. The results showed that the CET of females was always 1.12-1.29 times that of males. In addition, the CET after wearing face masks was 28.28-52.37 times as long as before. The working time can be determined based on the CET results of male workers wearing face masks exposed to the inverted-umbrella aeration tank (14.73-550.98 min for U.S. EPA benchmark and 55.07-1972.24 min for WHO benchmark). In each scenario, the variable parameter exposure concentration (ec) always showed the most influence on the CET results. After wearing the face masks, the removal fraction by employing face masks also had a significant effect on the results, only second to ec. Therefore, the wearing of face mask is the most convenient and effective measure to prolong the CET. Furthermore, practical methods to reducing bioaerosol concentration in WWTPs exposure are also necessary to extend CET and safeguard worker health. This study enriches the application range of reverse quantitative microbial risk assessment framework and provides theoretical support for stakeholders to establish reasonable working time threshold guidelines, and practical method and novel perspective to protect the on-site health risks of sewage workers exposing to various facilities.

AB  - Airborne infection risk analysis is usually performed for enclosed spaces where susceptible individuals are exposed to infectious airborne respiratory droplets by inhalation. It is usually based on exponential, dose-response models of which a widely used variant is the Wells-Riley (WR) model. We revisit this infection-risk estimate and extend it to the population level. We use an epidemiological model where the mode of pathogen transmission, airborne or contact, is explicitly considered. We illustrate the link between epidemiological models and the WR and the Gammaitoni and Nucci models. We argue that airborne infection quanta are, up to an overall density, airborne infectious respiratory droplets modified by a parameter that depends on biological properties of the pathogen, physical properties of the droplet and behavioural properties of the individual. We calculate the time-dependent risk of being infected for two scenarios. We show how the epidemic infection risk depends on the viral latent period and the event time, the time infection occurs. Infection risk follows the dynamics of the infected population. As the latent period decreases, infection risk increases. The longer a susceptible is present in the epidemic, the higher its risk of infection for equal exposure time to the pathogen is.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Plasmodium species are naturally transmitted by Anopheles mosquitos. The parasite infects red blood cells (RBCs) and can be transfused with blood products. In non-endemic areas, the main risk of infection arises from travellers coming back and people immigrating from malaria-endemic regions. Endemic countries face a permanent risk of infection from transfusion-transmitted malaria (TTM). TTM may cause life-threatening complications in patients dependent on blood donations. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of Plasmodium falciparum inactivation in RBC units by treatment with short-wavelength ultraviolet C (UVC) light in the absence of photochemical additives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RBC units were spiked with P. falciparum to a parasite density of 0.1%-1% and irradiated with up to 4.5 J/cm RESULTS: The lowest dose of 1.5 J/cm CONCLUSION: Pathogen reduction with UVC light was previously shown to be effective for different bacteria and viruses, but the inactivation of parasites in RBC concentrates was not addressed until now. The present study provides evidence for significant inactivation of P. falciparum-infected RBCs by UVC light.

AB  - The massive use and discharge of antibiotics have led to increasing concerns about antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in natural aquatic environments. Since the dose-response mechanisms of pathogens with AMR have not yet been fully understood, and the antibiotic resistance genes and bacteria-related data collection via field sampling and laboratory testing is time-consuming and expensive, designing a rapid approach to quantify the burden of AMR in the natural aquatic environment has become a challenge. To cope with such a challenge, a new approach involving an integrated machine-learning framework was developed by investigating the associations between the relative burden of AMR and easily accessible variables (i.e., relevant environmental variables and adjacent land-use patterns). The results, based on a real-world case analysis, demonstrate that the quantification speed has been reduced from 3-7 days, which is typical for traditional measurement procedures with field sampling and laboratory testing, to approximately 0.5 hours using the new approach. Moreover, all five metrics for AMR relative burden quantification exceed the threshold level of 85%, with F1-score surpassing 0.92. Compared to logistic regression, decision trees, and basic random forest, the adaptive random forest model within the framework significantly improves quantification accuracy without sacrificing model interpretability. Two environmental variables, dissolved oxygen and resistivity, along with the proportion of green areas were identified as three key feature variables for the rapid quantification. This study contributes to the enrichment of burden analyses and management practices for rapid quantification of the relative burden of AMR without dose-response information.

AB  - Metabolic disorders in maternal generation during the late egg-laying period have adverse effects on neonatal development. The study was conducted to clarify the effects of maternal feeding of hawthorn-leaf flavonoid (HF) on the microbial community and intestinal development of chicks. Breeder hens were fed a basic corn-soybean diet, while the treatment groups were supplemented with 30 or 60 mg/kg HF. The offspring chicks were divided into CON, LHF, and HHF groups according to the maternal treatments. Maternal HF supplementation at 60 mg/kg increased the average daily gain and decreased the feed conversion rate of chicks (P < 0.05), but did not affect the average daily feed intake. HF treatments increased the villus height to crypt depth ratio and up-regulated the protein expressions of PCNA, IGF-1R, PI3K and p-mTOR in the jejunum (P < 0.05) of 1-day-old and 14-day-old chicks. Additionally, maternal HF treatment up-regulated the mRNA expression of tight junction transmembrane proteins (occludin) and scaffolding proteins (ZO-1 and ZO-2) in the jejunum of 1-day-old chicks (P < 0.05). Moreover, the maternal effects of HF on ZO-1 expression could last for 14 d (P < 0.05). Interestingly, dietary HF supplementation altered the vertically transmitted microbial community from breeder hens to chicks, especially increased the relative abundance of probiotics (i.e., Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1) in the meconium of chicks (P < 0.05), which may help with early gut microbiota colonization and intestinal development. In summary, dietary HF supplementation for breeder hens altered the bacterial community of neonates and might promote intestinal development of chicks through the IGF-1R/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.

AB  - Marine microplastics (MPs) pollution, with rivers as a major source, leads to MPs accumulation in estuarine sediments, which are also nitrogen cycling hotspots. However, the impact of MPs on nitrogen cycling in estuarine sediments has rarely been documented. In this study, we conducted microcosm experiment to investigate the effects of commonly encountered polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS) MPs, with two MPs concentrations (0.3% and 3% wet sediment weight) based on environmental concentration considerations and dose-response effects, on sediment dissolved oxygen (DO) diffusion capacity and microbial communities using microelectrode system and metagenomic analysis respectively. The results indicated that high concentrations of PE-MPs inhibited DO diffusion during the mid-phase of the experiment, an effect that dissipated in the later stages. Metagenomic analysis revealed that MP treatments reduced the relative abundance of dominant microbial colonies in the sediments. The PCoA results demonstrated that MPs altered the microbial community structure, particularly evident under high concentration PE-MPs treatments. Functional analysis related to the nitrogen cycle suggested that PS-MPs promoted the nitrification, denitrification, and DNRA processes, but inhibited the ANRA process, while PE-MPs had an inhibitory effect on the nitrate reduction process and the ANRA process. Additionally, the high concentration of PE-MPs treatment significantly stimulated the abundance of genus (Bacillus) by 34.1% and genes (lip, pnbA) by 100-187.5% associated with plastic degradation, respectively. Overall, in terms of microbial community structure and the abundance of nitrogen cycling functional genes, PE- and PS- MPs exhibit both similarities and differences in their impact on nitrogen cycling. Our findings highlight the complexity of MP effects on nitrogen cycling in estuarine sediments and high concentrations of PE-MP stimulated plastic-degrading genus and genes.

AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes life-threatening infections especially in hospitalized patients and shows an increasing resistance to established antibiotics. A process known as quorum sensing (QS) enables the pathogen to collectively adapt to various environmental conditions. Disrupting this cell-to-cell communication machinery by small-molecular entities leads to a blockade of bacterial pathogenicity. We aim to devise QS inhibitors acting on the PA-specific PQS QS system via the signal-molecule receptor and transcriptional regulator PqsR (MvfR). In this manuscript, we describe the further optimization of PqsR inverse agonists by broadening the structural space of a previously described triazole-bearing lead compound and arriving at highly potent thiazole derivatives with activities against P. aeruginosa virulence factor pyocyanin in the nanomolar range. All new derivatives were profiled regarding biological activity as well as in vitro ADMET parameters. Additionally, we assessed safety-pharmacology characteristics of the two most promising compounds both bearing a 3-chloro-4-isopropoxyphenyl motive. Demonstrating an overall favorable profile, our new PqsR inverse agonists represent a valuable addition as optimized lead compounds, enabling preclinical development of P. aeruginosa-specific pathoblockers.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of dietary chlorogenic acid (CGA) on the productive and reproductive performance, egg quality, antioxidant function, and intestinal microenvironment of laying hens. Thus, 162 healthy Hy-Line Brown breeding hens (63 weeks old) were randomly allocated to 3 groups, each receiving a basal diet plus supplementation: 0, 250, and 500 mg/kg CGA, respectively. Per the in vitro test, CGA had obvious inhibitory effects on Salmonella enteritis and avian pathogenic Escherichia coli and strong free radical scavenging ability. Per the breeder laying hen experiment, the CGA diets had no significant influence on egg production or reproductive performance (P < 0.05). Nevertheless, compared with the control diet, 250 mg/kg CGA significantly increased eggshell thickness, egg weight, yolk color, and Haugh unit (P < 0.05). Compared with the control diet and 500 mg/kg CGA, 250 mg/kg CGA significantly (P < 0.05) elevated antioxidant capacity by reducing serum malondialdehyde content, upregulating heme oxygenase-1, and downregulating heat shock proteins mRNA levels in the ileum. Compared with the control diet and 500 mg/kg CGA, 250 mg/kg CGA (P < 0.05) enhanced intestinal barrier function, shown by the upregulation of ileal Occludin and Mucin-2 mRNA levels; furthermore, 250 mg/kg CGA (P < 0.05) increased anti-apoptotic capacity by increasing B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 gene expression and downregulated Bcl2 Associated X mRNA levels in the liver and ileum of late breeder laying hens (P < 0.05). Lastly, 250 mg/kg CGA (P < 0.05) increased cecal g_CHKCI001 and short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria g_Prevotellaceae UCG-001, positively related to gut health, and in the cecum, 500 mg/kg CGA significantly (P < 0.05) increased g_Shuttleworthia abundance, negatively related to gut health. Our findings suggest that dietary inclusion of 250 mg/kg CGA promotes egg quality, intestinal microbial composition, gut barrier integrity, and the antioxidant capacity of aged breeder laying hens.

AB  - Infectious disease caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) seriously threatens public health. The design of antimicrobial peptide mimics (AMPMs) based on natural products (NPs) is a new strategy to kill MRSA and slow the development of drug resistance recently. Here, we reported the design and synthesis of novel AMPMs based on harmane skeleton. Notably, compound 9b exhibited comparable or even better anti-MRSA activity in vitro and in vivo with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.5-2 μg/mL than the positive drug vancomycin. The highly active compound 9b not only showed low cytotoxicity, no obvious hemolysis and good plasma stability, but also presented low tendency of developing resistance. Anti-MRSA mechanism revealed that compound 9b could destroy cell wall structure by interacting with lipoteichoic acid and peptidoglycan, cause membrane damage by depolarization, increased permeability and destructed integrity, reduce cell metabolic activity by binding to lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), interfere cellular redox homeostasis, and bind to DNA. Overall, compound 9b killed the MRSA by multi-target mechanism, which provide a promising light for combating the growing MRSA resistance.

AB  - UNLABELLED: According to the World Health Organization, the number of tuberculosis (TB) infections and the drug-resistant burden worldwide increased by 4.5% and 3.0%, respectively, between 2020 and 2021. Disease severity and complexity drive the interest for undertaking new clinical trials to provide efficient treatment to limit spread and drug resistance. TB Alliance conducted a phase 2 study in 106 patients to guide linezolid (LZD) dose selection using early bactericidal activity over 14 days of treatment. LZD is highly efficient for drug-resistant TB treatment, but treatment monitoring is required since serious adverse events can occur. The objective of this study was to develop a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model to analyze the dose-response relationship between linezolid exposure and efficacy biomarkers. Using time to positivity (TTP) and colony-forming unit (CFU) count data, we developed a PKPD model in six dosing regimens, differing on LZD dosing intensity. A one-compartment model with five transit absorption compartments and non-linear auto-inhibition elimination described best LZD pharmacokinetic characteristics. TTP and CFU logarithmic scaled [log(CFU)] showed a bactericidal activity of LZD against  CLINICAL TRIALS: This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT02279875.

AB  - Both abdominal radiotherapy and a nuclear event can result in gastrointestinal symptoms, including acute radiation syndrome (GI-ARS). GI-ARS is characterized by compromised intestinal barrier integrity increasing the risk for infectious complications. Physiologically relevant animal models are crucial for elucidating host responses and therapeutic targets. We aimed to determine the radiation dose requirements for creating GI-ARS in the Sinclair minipig. Male, sexually mature swine were randomly divided into sham (n = 6) and three lower hemibody radiation dosage groups of 8, 10, and 12 Gy (n = 5/group) delivered using linear accelerator-derived x-rays (1.9 Gy/min). Animals were monitored for GI-ARS symptoms for 14 days with rectal swab and blood collection at days 0-3, 7, 10, and 14 followed by necropsy for western blotting and histology. Dose-dependent increases in weight loss, diarrhea severity, and mortality (log-rank test, P = 0.041) were seen. Villi length was significantly reduced in all irradiated animals compared to controls ( P < 0.001). Serum citrulline decreased and bacterial translocation increased after irradiation compared to controls. Increased NLRP3 levels in post-mortem jejunum were seen ( P = 0.0043) as well as increased IL-1β levels in the 12 Gy group ( P = 0.041). Radiation dose and survival were associated with significant gut microbial community shifts in beta diversity. Moreover, decedents had increased Porphyromonas, Campylobacter, Bacteroides , Parvimonas , and decreased Fusobacterium and decreased Aerococcus, Lactobacillus, Prevotella, and Streptococcus . Our novel Sinclair minipig model showed dose-dependent clinical symptoms of GI-ARS. These findings provide invaluable insights into the intricate interplay between GI-ARS, intestinal inflammation, and gut microbiota alterations offering potential targets for therapeutic and diagnostic interventions after radiation exposure.

AB  - To assess the antibacterial effectiveness of Lippia macrophylla essential oil (LMEO) against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolates, both as a standalone treatment and in combination with conventional antibiotics. LMEO demonstrated a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of A. baumannii, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) below 500 μg/mL. Notably, LMEO was capable of reversing the antibiotic resistance of clinical isolates or reducing their MIC values when used in combination with antibiotics, showing synergistic (FICI≤0.5) or additive effects. The combination of LMEO and imipenem was particularly effective, displaying synergistic interactions for most isolates. Ultrastructural analyses supported these findings, revealing that the combination of LMEO+ceftazidime compromised the membrane integrity of the Acb35 isolate, leading to cytoplasmic leakage and increased formation of Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs). Taken together our results point for the use of LMEO alone or in combination as an antibacterial agent against A. baumannii. These findings offer promising avenues for utilizing LMEO as a novel antibacterial strategy against drug-resistant infections in healthcare settings, underscoring the potential of essential oils in enhancing antibiotic efficacy.

AB  - Melanin is a complex brown pigment, primarily responsible for the skin pigmentation. Therefore, cosmetic industries have always been in search of potent oxidative enzymes useful for melanin degradation, and to promise a fair complexion after using their products. In the present study, lignin peroxidase from Pseudomonas fluorescence LiP-RL5 isolate has been immobilized on super-paramagnetic nanoparticles to enhance its stability and reusability. The chitosan coated enzyme-nanomaterial complex (LiP@MFO-Chit) showed higher melanin decolorization (47.30 ± 2.3 %) compared to the graphene oxide coated nanoparticles (LiP@MFO-GO) (41.60 ± 1.6 %). Synthesized enzyme nanoparticle complexes showed microbicidal effect on skin infection causing pathogen, Pantoea agglomerans with an inhibitory zone of 6.0 ± 0.9 mm and 250 µg/100 µl minimum inhibitory concentration, and a 7.0 ± 1.5 mm zone and 170 µg/100 µl MIC for LiP@MFO-GO and LiP@MFO-Chit, respectively. Antioxidant potential of LiP@MFO-Chit and LiP@MFO-GO nano-conjugates showed a substantial DPPH scavenging activity of 75.7 % and 88.3 %, respectively. Therefore, LiP-nanoparticle hybrid complexes analyzed in this study are not only effective as skin whitening agents but they are potential molecules against various microbial skin infections as well as useful for different other biomedical applications like biorefinery, drug delivery, and dermatology, etc.

AB  - With increasing health awareness of the pathogenic effects of disease-causing microorganisms, interest in and use (of medical textiles, disinfectants in medical devices, etc.) of antimicrobial substances have increased in various applications, such as medical textiles and disinfectants (alcohol-based and nonalcoholic), in medical devices There are several concerns with alcohol-based disinfectants, such as surface deformation of medical devices due to high alcohol content and damage to skin tissue caused by lipid and protein denaturation of cell membranes. Quaternary ammonium compounds (quats) were preferred because they have the potential to prepare water-based disinfectants. In this study, novel (3-chloropropyl)triethoxysilane (CPTMO) and (3-chloropropyl)triethoxysilane (CPTEO) based quaternary ammonium silane compounds (silane-quats) were developed using quats with carbon chain lengths of C12, C14, C16 and C18.

AB  - Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway is a crucial component of innate immunity that plays a vital role in protecting against pathogen infections and cellular stress. However, aberrant activation of cGAS-STING pathway is related to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Here, we developed cyclopeptide STING inhibitors by cyclizing the N-terminal tail (NTT) of STING. These cyclopeptides selectively inhibited the activation of STING pathway in human or murine cell lines. Mechanistically, the inhibitors directly bound to STING, and subsequently blocked the aggregation and activation of STING. In addition, the optimal inhibitor STi-2 significantly suppressed proinflammatory cytokine production and systemic inflammation in Trex1

AB  - Viral infectivity factor (Vif) has been recognized as a new therapeutic target for human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infected patients. In our previous work, we have synthesized a novel class of Vif inhibitors with 2-amino-N-(5-hydroxy-2-methoxyphenyl)-6-((4-nitrophenyl)thio)benzamide scaffold, which show obvious activity in HIV-1 infected cells and are also effective against drug-resistant strains. Proteolytic targeting chimera (PROTAC) utilizes the ubiquitin-proteasome system to degrade target proteins, which is well established in the field of cancer, but the antiviral PROTAC molecules are rarely reported. In order to explore the effectiveness of PROTAC in the antiviral area, we designed and synthesized a series of degrader of HIV-1 Vif based on 2-amino-N-(5-hydroxy-2-methoxyphenyl)-6-((4-nitrophenyl)thio)benzamide scaffold. Among them, L15 can degrade Vif protein obviously in a dose-dependent manner and shows certain antivirus activity. Meanwhile, molecular dynamics simulation indicated that the ternary complex formed by L15, Vif, and E3 ligase adopted a reasonable binding mode and maintained a stable interaction. This provided a molecular basis and prerequisite for the selective degradation of the Vif protein by L15. This study reports the HIV-1 Vif PROTAC for the first time and represents the proof-of-concept of PROTACs-based antiviral drug discovery in the field of HIV/ acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

AB  - The direct-linked coumarin-benzimidazole hybrids, featuring aryl and n-butyl substituents at the N1-position of benzimidazole were synthesized through a Knoevenagel condensation reaction. This reaction involved the condensation of 1,2-diaminobenzene derivatives with coumarin-3-carboxylic acids in the presence of polyphosphoric acid (PPA) at 154 °C. The in vitro antibacterial potency of the hybrid molecules against different gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains led to the identification of the hybrids 6m and 6p with a MIC value of 6.25 μg/mL against a gram-negative bacterium, Klebsiella pneumonia ATCC 27736. Cell viability studies on THP-1 cells demonstrated that the compounds 6m and 6p were non-toxic at a concentration of 50 µM. Furthermore, in vivo efficacy studies using a murine neutropenic thigh infection model revealed that both compounds significantly reduced bacterial (Klebsiella pneumonia ATCC 27736) counts (more than 2 log) compared to the control group. Additionally, both compounds exhibited favorable physicochemical properties and drug-likeness characteristics. Consequently, these compounds hold promise as lead candidates for further development of effective antibacterial drugs.

The design strategy was adjusted to account for the quinazoline scaffold's placement in the target kinases' hinge region, where it would form hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with the important amino acids to stabilize it, and the amide group's occupation in the gate region, which would direct the oxindole scaffold toward the hydrophobic back pocket. The two sets of quinazolines 8a-l and 10a-d displayed pronounced inhibitory activity on VEGFR-2 (IC

AB  - The rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance and the scarcity of novel antibacterial agents have necessitated an urgent pursuit for the discovery and development of novel antibacterial agents against multidrug-resistant bacteria. This study involved the design and synthesis of series of novel indole-benzosulfonamide oleanolic acid (OA) derivatives, in which the indole and benzosulfonamide pharmacophores were introduced into the OA skeleton semisynthetically. These target OA derivatives show antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus strains in vitro and in vivo. Among them, derivative c17 was the most promising antibacterial agent while compared with the positive control of norfloxacin, especially against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in vitro. In addition, derivative c17 also showed remarkable efficacy against MRSA-infected murine skin model, leading to a significant reduction of bacterial counts during this in vivo study. Furthermore, some preliminary studies indicated that derivative c17 could effectively inhibit and eradicate the biofilm formation, disrupt the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane. Moreover, derivative c17 showed low hemolytic activity and low toxicity to mammalian cells of NIH 3T3 and HEK 293T. These aforementioned findings strongly support the potential of novel indole-benzosulfonamide OA derivatives as anti-MRSA agents.

AB  - A novel class of pleuromutilin derivatives possessing 1,2,3-triazole as the linker connected to phenyl analogues were designed. The antibacterial properties of the prepared compounds were assessed in vitro against five strains (E. coli, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and E. faecalis). Most of the tested compounds displayed potent antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria and 14-O-[2-(4-((2,4-dinitrophenoxy)-methyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl) acetamide)-2-methylpropan-2-yl) thioacetyl]mutilin (7c) exerted antibacterial activities against S. aureus, MRSA and S. epidermidis with MIC values 0.0625 μg/mL, representing 64-fold, 4-fold and 8-fold higher than tiamulin respectively. Compound 6e, 7c and 8c were chosen to carry out killing kinetics, which exhibited concentration-dependent effect. Subsequently, molecular modeling was conducted to further explore the binding of compound 6e, 7a, 7c, 8c and tiamulin with 50S ribosomal subunit from deinococcus radiodurans. The investigation revealed that the main interactions between compound 7c and the ribosomal residues were three hydrogen bonds, π-π, and p-π conjugate effects. Additionally, the free binding energy and docking score of 7c with the ribosome demonstrated the lowest values of -11.90 kcal/mol and -7.97 kcal/mol, respectively, consistent with its superior antibacterial activities.

AB  - We report here on the structure-activity relationships of hybrids combining 3-descladinosyl clarithromycin with quinolones linked by extended diamine connectors. Several hybrids, exemplified by 23Bc, 23Be, 23Bf, 26Be, and 30Bc, not only restored potency against inducibly resistant pathogens but also exhibited significantly enhanced activities against constitutively resistant strains of Staphylococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus pyogenes, which express high-level resistance independent of clarithromycin or erythromycin induction. Additionally, the novel hybrids showed susceptibility against Gram-negative Haemophilus influenzae. Notably, hybrid 23Be demonstrated dual modes of action by inhibiting both protein synthesis and DNA replication in vitro and in vivo. Given these promising characteristics, 23Be emerges as a potential candidate for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.

AB  - Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating disease with a broad overlap of symptomatology with Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS). Despite the severity of symptoms and various neurological, cardiovascular, microvascular, and skeletal muscular findings, no biomarkers have been identified. The Transient receptor potential melastatin 3 (TRPM3) channel, involved in pain transduction, thermosensation, transmitter and neuropeptide release, mechanoregulation, vasorelaxation, and immune defense, shows altered function in ME/CFS. Dysfunction of TRPM3 in natural killer (NK) cells, characterized by reduced calcium flux, has been observed in ME/CFS and PCS patients, suggesting a role in ineffective pathogen clearance and potential virus persistence and autoimmunity development. TRPM3 dysfunction in NK cells can be improved by naltrexone in vitro and ex vivo, which may explain the moderate clinical efficacy of low-dose naltrexone (LDN) treatment. We propose that TRPM3 dysfunction may have a broader involvement in ME/CFS pathophysiology, affecting other organs. This paper discusses TRPM3's expression in various organs and its potential impact on ME/CFS symptoms, with a focus on small nerve fibers and the brain, where TRPM3 is involved in presynaptic GABA release.

AB  - As an important means to solve water shortage, reclaimed water has been widely used for landscape water supply. However, with the emergence of large-scale epidemic diseases such as SARS, avian influenza and COVID-19 in recent years, people are increasingly concerned about the public health safety of reclaimed water discharged into landscape water, especially the pathogenic microorganisms in it. In this study, the water quality and microorganisms of the Old Summer Palace, a landscape water body with reclaimed water as the only replenishment water source, were tracked through long-term dynamic monitoring. And the health risks of indicator microorganisms were analyzed using Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA). It was found that the concentration of indicator microorganisms Enterococcus (ENT), Escherichia coli (EC) and Fecal coliform (FC) generally showed an upward trend along the direction of water flow and increased by more than 0.6 log at the end of the flow. The concentrations of indicator microorganisms were higher in summer and autumn than those in spring. And there was a positive correlation between the concentration of indicator microorganisms and COD. Further research suggested that increased concentration of indicator microorganisms also led to increased health risks, which were more than 30% higher in other areas of the park than the water inlet area and required special attention. In addition, (water) surface operation exposure pathway had much higher health risks than other pathways and people in related occupations were advised to take precautions to reduce the risks.

AB  - Influenza remains a global public health threat, and the development of new antivirals is crucial to combat emerging drug-resistant influenza strains. In this study, we report the synthesis and evaluation of a sialyl lactosyl (TS)-bovine serum albumin (BSA) conjugate as a potential multivalent inhibitor of the influenza virus. The key trisaccharide component, TS, was efficiently prepared via a chemoenzymatic approach, followed by conjugation to dibenzocyclooctyne-modified BSA via a strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction. Biophysical and biochemical assays, including surface plasmon resonance, isothermal titration calorimetry, hemagglutination inhibition, and neuraminidase inhibition, demonstrated the strong binding affinity of TS-BSA to the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins of the influenza virus as well as intact virion particles. Notably, TS-BSA exhibited potent inhibitory activity against viral entry and release, preventing cytopathic effects in cell culture. This multivalent presentation strategy highlights the potential of glycocluster-based antivirals for combating influenza and other drug-resistant viral strains.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to see how different levels of Se-chitosan, a novel organic source of Se, affected the production performance, egg quality, egg Se concentration, microbial population, immunological response, antioxidant status, and yolk fatty acid profile of laying Japanese quail. This experiment used a totally randomized design, with 5 treatments, 6 repeats, and 10 birds in each repetition. The dietary treatment groups were as follows: no Se supplementation (control group), 0.2 mg/kg Na-selenite supplementation, and 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/kg Se-chitosan supplementation. The feed conversion ratio (FCR) improved linearly in quails fed different levels of Se-chitosan compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, Se-chitosan at concentrations of 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg demonstrated both linear and quadratic increases in albumen height, Haugh unit, and yolk color in fresh eggs compared to the control group. Additionally, Se-chitosan contributed to enhanced shell thickness and strength, along with an increased Se concentration in the yolk. Se-chitosan supplementation at different levels linearly and quadratically reduced coliforms (COL) while increasing lactic acid bacteria (LAB)/coliform ratios (P < 0.05). Se-chitosan supplementation linearly and quadratically increased the total antibody response to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and IgG titers (P < 0.05). It also linearly decreased the level of malondialdehyde in fresh and stored egg yolks and increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes catalase and glutathione peroxidase linearly, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) both linearly and quadratically in quail blood serum (P < 0.05). Additionally, supplementation of Se-chitosan at levels of 0.2 and 0.6 mg/kg linearly decreased the ∑ n-6 PUFA/∑ n-3 PUFA ratio in the yolk compared to the control group (P < 0.05). It can be concluded that incorporating Se-chitosan as a novel organic source of Se in the diet of laying quails can enhance production performance, egg quality, egg Se concentration, yolk lipid oxidation, microbial population, immune response, antioxidant enzyme activity, and yolk fatty acid profile.

AB  - Infection with Glaesserella parasuis, the primary pathogen behind Glässer's disease, is often associated with diverse clinical symptoms, including serofibrinous polyserositis, arthritis, and meningitis. Autophagy plays a dual role in bacterial infections, exerting either antagonistic or synergistic effects depending on the nature of the pathogen. Our previous studies have demonstrated that autophagy serves as a defense mechanism, combating inflammation and invasion caused by infection of highly virulent G. parasuis. However, the precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Pathogens exhibit distinct interactions with inflammasomes and autophagy processes. Herein, we explored the effect of autophagy on inflammasomes during G. parasuis infection. We found that G. parasuis infection triggers NLRP3-dependent pro-CASP-1-IL-18/IL-1β processing and maturation pathway, resulting in increased release of IL-1β and IL-18. Inhibition of autophagy enhances NLRP3 inflammasome activity, whereas stimulation of autophagy restricts it during G. parasuis infection. Furthermore, assembled NLRP3 inflammasomes undergo ubiquitination and recruit the autophagic adaptor, p62, facilitating their sequestration into autophagosomes during G. parasuis infection. These results suggest that the induction of autophagy mitigates inflammation by eliminating overactive NLRP3 inflammasomes during G. parasuis infection. Our research uncovers a mechanism whereby G. parasuis infection initiates inflammatory responses by promoting the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasomes and activating NLRP3-CASP-1, both of which processes are downregulated by autophagy. This suggests that pharmacological manipulation of autophagy could be a promising approach to modulate G. parasuis-induced inflammatory responses.

AB  - Lauric acid (LA), a saturated fatty acid with 12 carbon atoms, is widely regarded as a healthy fatty acid that plays an important role in disease resistance and improving immune physiological function. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of dietary lauric acid on the growth performance, antioxidant capacity, non-specific immunity and intestinal microbiology, and evaluate the potential of lauric acids an environmentally friendly additive in swimming crab (Portunus trituberculatus) culture. A total of 192 swimming crabs with an initial body weight of 11.68 ± 0.02 g were fed six different dietary lauric acid levels, the analytical values of lauric acid were 0.09, 0.44, 0.80, 1.00, 1.53, 2.91 mg/g, respectively. There were four replicates per treatment and 8 juvenile swimming crabs per replicate. The results indicated that final weight, percent weight gain, specific growth rate, survival and feed intake were not significantly affected by dietary lauric acid levels; however, crabs fed diets with 0.80 and 1.00 mg/g lauric acid showed the lowest feed efficiency among all treatments. Proximate composition in hepatopancreas and muscle were not significantly affected by dietary lauric acid levels. The highest activities of amylase and lipase in hepatopancreas and intestine were found at crabs fed diet with 0.80 mg/g lauric acid (P < 0.05), the activity of carnitine palmityl transferase (CPT) in hepatopancreas and intestine significantly decreased with dietary lauric acid levels increasing from 0.09 to 2.91 mg/g (P < 0.05). The lowest concentration of glucose and total protein and the activity of alkaline phosphatase in hemolymph were observed at crabs fed diets with 0.80 and 1.00 mg/g lauric acid among all treatments. The activity of GSH-Px in hepatopancreas significantly increased with dietary lauric acid increasing from 0.09 to 1.53 mg/g, MDA in hepatopancreas and hemolymph was not significantly influenced by dietary lauric acid levels. The highest expression of cat and gpx in hepatopancreas were exhibited in crabs fed diet with 1.00 mg/g lauric acid, however, the expression of genes related to the inflammatory signaling pathway (relish, myd88, traf6, nf-κB) were up-regulated in the hepatopancreas with dietary lauric acid levels increasing from 0.09 to 1.00 mg/g, moreover, the expression of genes related to intestinal inflammatory, immune and antioxidant were significantly affected by dietary lauric acid levels (P < 0.05). Crabs fed diet without lauric acid supplementation exhibited higher lipid drop area in hepatopancreas than those fed the other diets (P < 0.05). The expression of genes related to lipid catabolism was up-regulated, however, and the expression of genes related to lipid synthesis was down-regulated in the hepatopancreas of crabs fed with 0.80 mg/g lauric acid. Lauric acid improved hepatic tubular integrity, and enhanced intestinal barrier function by increasing peritrophic membrane (PM) thickness and upregulating the expression of structural factors (per44, zo-1) and intestinal immunity-related genes. In addition, dietary 1.00 mg/g lauric acid significantly improved the microbiota composition of the intestinal, increased the abundance of Actinobacteria and Rhodobacteraceae, and decreased the abundance of Vibrio, thus maintaining the microbiota balance of the intestine. The correlation analysis showed that there was a relationship between intestinal microbiota and immune-antioxidant function. In conclusion, the dietary 1.00 mg/g lauric acid is beneficial to improve the antioxidant capacity and intestinal health of swimming crab.

AB  - Life-threatening invasive fungal infections pose a serious threat to human health. A series of novel triazole derivatives bearing a pyrazole-methoxyl moiety were designed and synthesized in an effort to obtain antifungals with potent, broad-spectrum activity that are less susceptible to resistance. Most of these compounds exhibited moderate to excellent in vitro antifungal activities against Candida albicans SC5314 and 10,231, Cryptococcus neoformans 32,609, Candida glabrata 537 and Candida parapsilosis 22,019 with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of ≤0.125 μg/mL to 0.5 μg/mL. Use of recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains showed compounds 7 and 10 overcame the overexpression and resistant-related mutations in ERG11 of S. cerevisae and several pathogenic Candida spp. Despite being substrates of the C. albicans and Candida auris Cdr1 drug efflux pumps, compounds 7 and 10 showed moderate potency against five fluconazole (FCZ)-resistant fungi with MIC values from 2.0 μg/mL to 16.0 μg/mL. Growth kinetics confirmed compounds 7 and 10 had much stronger fungistatic activity than FCZ. For C. albicans, compounds 7 and 10 inhibited the yeast-to-hyphae transition, biofilm formation and destroyed mature biofilm more effectively than FCZ. Preliminary mechanism of action studies showed compounds 7 and 10 blocked the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway at Erg11, ultimately leading to cell membrane disruption. Further investigation of these novel triazole derivatives is also warranted by their predicted ADMET properties and low cytotoxicity.
