    "abstract": "The reuse of wastewater in agriculture on a single-family scale presents a series of challenges regarding operation, maintenance, and sanitary safety. The present study therefore aimed to assess the potential microbiological risks to which users of a variant of septic tank (biodigester septic tank, BST) are exposed when using this system for treating blackwater (wastewater from toilets) and to propose control measures using the quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) methodology. This methodology entailed mapping the routes of exposure and calculating the probabilistic infection risk of E. coli. The results indicated that there is a microbiological health risk associated with the BST maintenance and usage. It was proposed that the fresh bovine feces addition for system maintenance should be stopped and that the reuse of the effluent for agricultural purposes should be reused via subsurface irrigation. It is therefore vital to exercise caution and implement a risk management strategy in order to ensure the safe dissemination of this technology in Brazil and Latin America.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Linezolid (LZD), a commonly used antimicrobial agent in clinical practice, has not undergone adequate pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment in pediatric populations with renal impairment (RI). Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling provides unique benefits for investigating drug pharmacokinetics in specific patient groups. This study aimed to employ the PBPK model to refine and optimize the therapeutic dosing protocol of LZD for RI pediatric patients. METHODS: The model was developed and validated for both healthy adults and RI adults, which was subsequently adapted for pediatric applications. Upon verification of the pediatric Based on clinical PK data and real-world study findings, the PBPK model demonstrated precise prediction of LZD exposure in pediatric populations with varying degrees of RI, encompassing weight- and age-associated PK variations. RESULTS: The PBPK modeling simulations exhibited robust agreement with observational data for LZD across both oral and intravenous delivery routes under diverse dosing protocols, as evidenced by the fold error (FE) always between 0.5 and 2 times, geometric mean fold error (GMFE) was less than 2.0 and mean absolute prediction error (MAPE) was within 100%. Pediatric populations with severe or end-stage RI exhibited 1.21-fold and 1.28-fold elevations in plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) values, respectively, relative to healthy pediatric counterparts when administered equivalent 10 mg/kg LZD doses. Pharmacodynamic analysis confirmed that the proposed dosing regimens-8 mg/kg every 8 hours for children with severe or end-stage RI -were effective in achieving the target AUC CONCLUSION: Our model provides a predictive instrument to enhance precision in determining therapeutic LZD dosage regimens for pediatric populations through systematic integration of developmental PK parameters.",

    "abstract": "Predicting bacterial behavior and strain variability is essential for quantitative microbial risk assessments in food safety. The growing availability of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data enables deeper insights into microbial thermotolerance. However, capturing the reduction behavior of Campylobacter jejuni during thermal inactivation, while accounting for strain variability, remains challenging. We aimed to develop a machine-learning model leveraging amino acid phylogenetic information from WGS data to predict the reduction behavior and strain variability of C. jejuni during thermal inactivation. We developed a machine learning model utilizing 38 complete genomes of C. jejuni and their parameters of modified Weibull models describing the reduction behaviors heated at 55 °C. Correlation analyses identified genes that could be relevant to thermotolerance and highlighted genes potentially linked to thermotolerance. Leave-one-out cross-validation yielded a root mean square error of 0.83 log. Strain variability was further estimated using 679 genomes from genomic databases. Strain variability exhibited a multimodal distribution with one prominent peak and three minor peaks, indicating that traditional unimodal distributions could not fully represent the variability in C. jejuni thermal reduction. The machine-learning model effectively predicted reduction behavior and strain variability of C. jejuni during thermal inactivation using WGS data. Nonetheless, its prediction range is limited by the diversity of the training set, suggesting that broader genomic datasets could enhance accuracy. These findings provide a pathway for improved microbial risk assessments through genomic data integration.",

Allicin, the primary biologically active component found in freshly crushed garlic extracts, has been reported to possess many beneficial biological functions. METHODS: An animal model was used to evaluate the efficacy of allicin on GA rats, and 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomics were used to explore changes in the gut microbiota and metabolites. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) used to explore the mechanism of allicin treating GA. RESULTS: The results showed that allicin effectively improved the general state of GA rats, inhibited XOD activity, and significantly reduced ROS production and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby exerting therapeutic efficacy to protect the kidneys and joints. Examination of the gut microbiota showed that the composition of the gut microbiota of GA rats improved after allicin treatment (increase in  CONCLUSION: This study highlights allicin as a promising therapeutic candidate for GA, emphasizing its potential to inhibit oxidative stress and inflammatory responses by regulating the gut-joint axis.",

Results demonstrated that the core nitrogen removal pathway of the PN/A system persisted, despite antibiotic-induced metabolic deceleration and biomass reduction. The floc sludge-based system exhibited resilience by recovering from low-dose antibiotic stress (10-100 μg/L) and even achieving enhanced nitrogen removal under high-dose exposure (200-1000 μg/L). This resilience was supported by three microbial strategies: (i) adaptive evolution dominated by Proteobacteria; (ii) enhanced interaction networks, as indicated by greater network complexity, calcium signaling pathway, two-component systems, and cell motility; and (iii) strengthened secretion systems for self-protection through elevated ABC transporters and biofilm formation. This study deciphers adaptive mechanisms of floc sludge-based PN/A systems to antibiotics and provides a scientific basis for their application in environments with fluctuating antibiotic stress.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB), especially in its drug-resistant form, remains a critical public health challenge in sub-Saharan Africa, where conventional airborne transmission has been well-characterized. However, wastewater systems prevalent across urban centres may serve as overlooked environmental reservoirs for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, posing occupational and environmental health risks. Despite this, the health implications of wastewater exposure remain underexplored, particularly in high TB-burden settings. To address this research gap, we applied the Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) framework, incorporating Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), to assess the health risks of exposure to drug-resistant TB pathogens in wastewater. Our study uniquely focuses on three exposure scenarios: untreated wastewater at the head of works, aerosols from aeration tanks, and reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation, across six African countries: Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Cameroon, and South Africa. The study found the highest concentrations of M. tuberculosis in Ghana, with rifampicin-resistant strains present at lower levels across all countries. Infection risks ranged from 3 % to 100 %, with irrigation posing the highest median infection risk (0.77). The greatest disease burdens were observed at the head of works (112.46 DALYs) and during irrigation (105.31 DALYs). Our findings highlight wastewater as a significant and previously underestimated route for TB transmission. This study underscores the urgent need for enhanced treatment technologies, occupational safety protocols, and environmental surveillance. Integrating wastewater-based epidemiology into national TB monitoring could provide a valuable early-warning system, especially in regions reusing wastewater for agriculture, and may significantly strengthen global TB control strategies.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use quantitative magnetic resonance angiography (qMRA) to investigate the haemodynamic influences on cerebral circulation after hybrid thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). METHODS: Between January 2016 and October 2019, zone 1 and 2 TEVAR with supra-arch rerouting procedure in extra-anatomical fashion was performed in 24 patients (mean age 72.9 ± 11.7 years) and hybrid total arch replacement (TAR) was performed in eight patients (mean age 72.0 ± 8.5 years), all of whom underwent qMRA before and after the procedure. Degenerative and dissected aneurysms were observed in 23 and nine cases, respectively. Blood flow in the internal carotid artery (ICA) and vertebral artery (VA) was measured using qMRA. The anterior and posterior cerebral circulation flows were defined as the sum of bilateral ICA and VA flows, respectively. Total intracranial blood flow (TICF) was defined as the sum of anterior and posterior cerebral circulation flows. The pre- and post-operative values of these parameters were compared for each procedure. RESULTS: Zone 1 and 2 TEVAR caused no significant post-operative differences in TICF or anterior and posterior cerebral circulation. The right VA flow increased statistically significantly after zone 1 and 2 TEVAR (median [interquartile range] 68.0 mL/min [36.8, 95.5] vs. 110.5 mL/min [76.0, 159.5] mL/min; p < .001), whereas the left VA flow decreased statistically significantly (median [interquartile range] 92.0 mL/min [60.3, 107.0] vs. 39.0 mL/min [19.3, 81.0]; p < .001). The post-operative ICA flow was maintained at the pre-operative level after all procedures. The hybrid TAR group showed no significant post-operative differences in TICF or anterior and posterior cerebral circulation. The post-operative distribution of each branch flow was also not significantly different from the pre-operative distribution. CONCLUSION: Although VA flow showed a disproportionate distribution in the posterior circulation after zone 1 and 2 TEVAR, TICF remained comparable with the pre-operative level after both zone 1 and 2 TEVAR and TAR.",

The discovery of new antifungal agents is urgently required. Here, we developed a new series of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (Menadione) Tethered to 1H-1,2,3-triazolyl-selenoester in good yields, which exhibit antifungal potential activity against Candida species. Antifungal and antibiofilm activities for the twenty-one compounds were performed in vitro against Candida spp and exhibited inhibitory effects at different concentrations for several Candida species. Two compounds showed strong inhibitory effects, with fungicidal activity at 16 and 32 μg/mL, respectively, against planktonic cells and biofilms of Candida glabrata. In silico studies were conducted to determine the binding energies against BonFIRE spectral images of antifungal protein targets, and provided stereo electronic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological profiles. The analysis through molecular docking with CYP51 and Hsp90 highlighted the inhibitory potential of the compounds in comparison to itraconazole and radicicol, and further underscored the favorable pharmacokinetic profile for all molecules, characterized by a low toxicity profile. We therefore concluded that two compounds especially exhibited potent antifungal activity against C. glabrata.",

    "abstract": "Nitazoxanide (NTZ), an FDA-approved drug, served as the framework for synthesizing 22 new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents from 4-aminosalicylic acid via protection-deprotection, Staudinger reduction, Clauson-Kaas pyrrole synthesis, and nucleophilic substitution. These compounds were evaluated for antibacterial, antimycobacterial, and antitrypanosomal activities. Several compounds, particularly 10, 11, 13, and 22, surpassed the antibacterial activity of NTZ and its active metabolite tizoxanide (TIZ) against all tested pathogens, with MICs ranging from 1.025 to 9.81 μM. Compounds 10 and 13 were twice as potent as ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, while 11 and 17 were equipotent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC 5.34 μM). Compounds 11 and 14 matched ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 3.20 and 2.98 µM), whereas 13 and 21 were 1.5- and 2.5-fold more potent against Enterococcus faecalis, respectively. Compound 10 outperformed ciprofloxacin against Helicobacter pylori (MIC 1.025 μM). Compounds 6 (MIC 9.46 μM) and 7 (MIC 16.78 μM) outperformed NTZ against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and compound 3 emerged as a promising antitrypanosomal agent (MICs 2.59-4.73 μg/mL) against six Trypanosoma species. Cytotoxicity and pharmacokinetic studies confirmed the compounds' favorable drug-like properties and high selectivity. Docking results showed strong binding to key targets like pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase (G6PS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). Overall, several NTZ derivatives, particularly compounds 3, 6, 10, 11, 13, and 22, showed potent broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and offer convenient leads for further optimization.",

    "abstract": "With the continued upsurge of antibiotic resistance and reduced susceptibility to almost all frontline antibiotics, there is a pressing need for the development of new, effective, and safe alternatives. In this study, a scaffold-hopping strategy was utilized to develop a novel class of penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a) inhibitors, centered around a 4H-chromen-4-one core structure. These newly designed compounds demonstrated strong antibacterial efficacy against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other drug-resistant gram-positive pathogens. Notably, compounds 16 and 18-20 exhibited significant potency against the tested Staphylococcal strains, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 0.008 to 1 μg/mL, outperforming standard treatments such as vancomycin and linezolid, as well as the reference compound III. These derivatives also retained their activity against a range of clinically relevant multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria and showed no detectable cytotoxicity in human cell assays. Additionally, compounds 19 and 20 displayed synergistic effects when co-administered with β-lactam antibiotics against two MRSA strains. Finally, these derivatives exhibited excellent binding affinities to the allosteric site of PBP2a, with dissociation constants ranging from 13 to 23 μM, indicating that this novel class inhibits PBP2a as the primary target by binding non-covalently to its allosteric site, hence impairing cell-wall crosslinking, and resulting in cell death. Accordingly, the reported 4H-chromen-4-one-based class of inhibitors merit further investigation as potential therapeutic options for treatment of staphylococcal infections.",

    "abstract": "Disruption of the epidermal barrier contributes to skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, plays a key role in skin homeostasis and immune regulation. While traditionally associated with toxicity, AhR has emerged as a promising therapeutic target, particularly via tryptophan-derived indoles. To support AhR research in a dermatological context, we developed AhaRaCaT, a stable luciferase-based reporter cell line derived from human keratinocytes (HaCaT), enabling the assessment of AhR transcriptional activity in a skin-relevant model. We characterized the inducibility of AhaRaCaT in response to model AhR ligands (TCDD, BaP, FICZ) in dose- and time-dependent assays. Antagonist profiling with MNF, CH223191, GNF, carvone, and jasmone yielded IC50 values over 4- and 24-hour exposures. A panel of indoles previously studied in other models was evaluated for AhR activation, revealing a robust luciferase response at 4 h that declined at 24 h, consistent with trends observed in other cell types. Selected indoles also induced CYP1A1 mRNA expression and reversed cytokine-induced downregulation of filaggrin in HaCaT cells, highlighting their potential in mitigating inflammation-associated skin barrier defects. In summary, the AhaRaCaT cell line offers a sensitive and physiologically relevant tool for studying AhR signaling in skin, with broad applications in toxicology, dermatological research, and the development of AhR-targeted therapies for inflammatory skin diseases.",

This work aimed to evaluate the antifungal potential of synthetic chalcones against Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (Pb) and to determine in silico possible therapeutic targets. An in silico evaluation of a database of 21 synthesized chalcones was carried out based on pharmacokinetic parameters, enzymatic inhibition, Tanimoto similarity, and the prediction of the spectrum of activity by PASS (prediction of activity spectra of substances). The most viable chalcones from the previous evaluation were selected for the measurement of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against Pb and for cytotoxicity assays pre- and post-metabolization using HEPG2 cells. After in silico evaluation, the compounds 4, 11, 12, 20, and 21 were selected to carry out the molecular docking and in vitro tests. In the docking studies, multiple hydrophobic and polar intermolecular interactions were observed, such as hydrogen bonds, with emphasis on compound 20 in the active site of thioredoxin, where it made 4 hydrogen bonds with the residues Gln43, Ala36, and Thr38. In vitro testing revealed antifungal activity, with the MICs ranging from 32 to 128 μg/mL. In cytotoxicity assays, the 5 compounds exhibited reduced IC",

Some target compounds exhibited effective antibacterial activities against the tested strains. Especially, butyl BI 6c and 5-hydroxy BI 26d exerted excellent inhibitory activity toward Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and MRSA 43300 with a low MIC value of 0.5 and 0.25 μg/mL, being 2- and 4-fold more active than norfloxacin, respectively. BIs 6c and 26d displayed inconspicuous hemolytic rates and good pharmacokinetics. Moreover, BIs 6c and 26d could effectively inhibit and eliminate bacterial biofilms and block the development of resistance. Preliminary mechanistic investigations revealed that BIs 6c and 26d could trigger bacterial oxidative stress, intercalate into DNA, and bind with DNA gyrase B, which showed multitargeting antibacterial potential. Furthermore, BI 26d displayed superior anti-MRSA 43300 efficacy to norfloxacin in vivo. These findings suggested that benzopyronyl imidazolidinediones might provide new promise as potential new structural multitargeting antibacterial candidates for the prevention and treatment of Staphylococcus aureus.",

Serum pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β) decreased, contrasting with increases in immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG) and enhanced superoxide dismutase activity. Microbiota restructuring featured ruminal enrichment of Bifidobacterium and fecal dominance of Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, coupled with suppression of pro-inflammatory taxa (e.g., Christensenellaceae_R-7_group). Metabolomic analysis identified four ARWD-responsive biomarkers, notably Spirotaccagenin and Pelanin, operating through linoleic acid metabolism and phospholipase D signaling pathways. Strong correlations linked microbial shifts to improved lactation parameters and reduced inflammation. CONCLUSION: The findings establish that ARWD alleviates SCBM through coordinated microbiota remodeling and metabolic reprogramming, specifically enhancing antioxidant defenses, restoring mammary barrier integrity, and modulating immune-inflammation crosstalk, with optimal efficacy at 0.4 g·kg",

    "abstract": "Acne which is caused by Cutibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria is the most common skin problem among adolescents and young adults. Topical antibiotics like tetracycline are commonly used to treat acne but their effectiveness has declined as bacteria develop antibiotic resistance. Thus, this research emphasizes the antibacterial properties of new synthetic derivatives of halogenated xanthone and benzophenone (1a-1f), (2a-2d), (3a-3i), and (4a-4j) via in vitro antibacterial assay with tetracycline, erythromycin, and salicylic acid as reference standards. Based on the well diffusion assay (WDA), compound 1 f revealed the most potent antibacterial properties by inhibiting the acne-causing bacteria strains with a recorded inhibition zone of 15.67 ± 0.58 mm (C. acnes; ATCC 6919), 16.00 ± 0.00 mm (C. acnes; ATCC 11827), 15.00 ± 0.00 mm (S. aureus; ATCC 6538), and 30.00 ± 0.00 mm (S. aureus; ATCC 10832). These findings were further supported by the MIC and MBC values of compound 1 f, which ranged from 0.02 to 0.50 mg/mL. Next, the structure-activity relationship study revealed the attachment of different substituents at different positions that were responsible for the potent activity of compound 1 f. Compound 1 f reveals good binding affinity values towards C. acnes and S. aureus and better interaction with the protein active site. In silico study of drug-likeness and therapeutic effectiveness properties, including Lipinski's 'rule of five', Veber's rule, and ADME properties, projected that the compound 1 f would be toxicity-free, non-carcinogenic, and risk-free, which could be used as a better therapeutic agent for acne formulation with a guarantee for healthy skin.",

Here, new dimethyl quaternary ammonium salt 5b derived from harmane were designed, exhibiting potent anti-MRSA activities including clinical strains (MIC = 0.25-0.5 μg/mL) with rapid bactericidal mode, slow resistance acquisition, favorable stability and low cytotoxicity and hemolytic toxicity. Moreover, compound 5b demonstrated effective therapeutic effects in the mouse skin infection model, being competitive compared with vancomycin. Mechanistic investigations revealed that compound 5b inhibited biofilm formation by reducing extracellular polysaccharides, damaged the structure and function of cell wall by binding to peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acids (LTA), targeted to membranes by interaction with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) accompanying with depolarization, permeability alteration and integrity damage. Especially, compound 5b could further reduce intracellular metabolic activity, disrupt the redox balance with increasing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreasing activity of glutathione (GSH) as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD). Moreover, compound 5b could bind to DNA driven by entropy and enthalpy via a spontaneous process. Overall, this work provided a prominent anti-MRSA lead candidate, managing resistant infections by multi-target mechanism.",

The ADMET predictions indicated favorable pharmacokinetic profiles and minimal toxicity for most of the compounds. Molecular docking revealed strong binding with CDK2, supporting their anticancer potential.

To capture the DR dynamics, understanding the pathogenesis of the infectious agent is desirable. Typically, attempting to understand the DR dynamics would involve within-host mathematical modelling and fitting DR curves to experimental data. No mathematical model exists that describes the within-host dynamics that occur within an individual infected with Legionnaires' disease. Further, most DR models are based either on a single-hit or threshold hypothesis for the cause of illness. Here, we derive a model to explain within-host dynamics post-infection with Legionnaires' disease that incorporates heterogeneity at the cellular and population levels. We develop a new DR model that allows for either of two hypotheses for the cause of illness, adding a new level of flexibility not currently seen in the literature. We extend the DR model to incorporate time as we develop a dose-dependent incubation-period model that is based on biological mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are widely used in various fields, including medicine, food products, water filtration systems, cosmetics, textiles, and packaging, due to their powerful antimicrobial activity. However, chronic exposure to AgNPs was found to pose risks to human health owing to their highly reactive surface, large surface area, and the potential to penetrate the blood brain barrier (BBB). In this study, the effects of chronic oral administration of AgNPs on the cognitive and behavioral functions of rats were investigated, and the molecular mechanisms underlying AgNPs-induced neurotoxicity were reported. Male Wistar adult rats were orally administered doses ranging from 10 μg/kg body weight (BW) to 10 mg/kg BW/day for 90 days. Results revealed that the effects of chronic oral administration of AgNPs were dose dependent. Spatial learning, memory, and locomotor activity in rats were impaired at doses above 500 μg/kg BW/day. Significant decline in the levels of brain neurotransmitters, including serotonin and acetylcholinesterase, was observed at doses above 100 μg/kg BW/day. However, a significant reduction in dopamine levels was observed to be between 10 and 100 μg/kg BW/day, indicating that dopaminergic pathways are highly sensitive to AgNPs exposure, even at minimal concentrations. Interesentingly, increase in oxidative stress markers (ROS, protein carbonylation and MDA) at doses above 100 μg/Kg BW/day, decrease in antioxidant potential (GSH and TAC) at dose of 10 μg/Kg BW/day, induction of DNA damage (8-OHdG), and apoptosis in the brain at doses above 100 μg/Kg BW/day were observed. Furthermore, H&E staining and immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue revealed inflammation, apoptosis and alterations in brain architecture, with signs of degeneration observed at doses starting from 10 μg/kg BW/day. The presence of AgNPs was also detected in the cerebral cortex of animals receiving 2 and 5 mg/kg BW/day. The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for chronic administration of starch-coated AgNPs on brain health was determined to be 10 μg/kg BW/day, demonstrating that even low-dose, long-term exposure to AgNPs poses significant risks to the central nervous system.",

The incidence rates were 81.8% in pure juices, 70% in nectars, and 90% in juice concentrates. Five samples (16%) exceeded the maximum authorized limit for Pb (0.03 mg/kg) according to the standards of the European Commission, the Codex Alimentarius, and the Moroccan authorities. In the case of Cd, it was detected in 74.2% of samples, with levels ranging from 0.014 to 0.041 mg/kg (average: 0.025 mg/kg). Although no specific regulatory limit has been set for Cd in juices, the concentrations observed greatly exceeded the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) reference (0.005 mg/L) for drinking water. The non-carcinogenic risk assessment, based on hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI) values, revealed values of less than 1, indicating no significant long-term health risk.

    "abstract": "Lugdunin, a newly discovered antibiotic with a unique structure, emerged during a decade-long antibiotic discovery void and is considered a promising lead for combating drug-resistant bacteria. However, its narrow spectrum targeting only Gram-positive bacteria and its structural limitations have hindered its development and clinical application. Herein, inspired by our previous combinatorial modification strategies for lugdunin, we designed and synthesized a series of multi-cationic lugdunin derivatives using a biphenylmethyl modification on the tryptophan indole structure combined with multi-cationic amino acid mutations, aiming to expand its antimicrobial spectrum. Our results showed that the optimized derivative, Lug-15, exhibited strong antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Lug-15 rapidly kills bacteria primarily through membrane disruption and had a very low propensity to induce bacterial resistance. Additionally, it demonstrated low hemolytic toxicity and significant therapeutic potential in various infection models, including keratitis caused by MRSA and P. aeruginosa, MRSA-induced pneumonia, thigh muscle infection, and wound infection, indicating Lug-15's broad-spectrum therapeutic potential. Therefore, this study overcomes the historical limitation of prior SAR attempts and offers a new lead for combating drug-resistant bacteria.",

The methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, crucial for isoprenoid biosynthesis in many pathogenic bacteria, including K. pneumoniae, represents a promising source of targets for antibacterial drug discovery. In this study, we targeted the enzyme 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXPS) from K. pneumoniae that catalyzes the initial step of the MEP pathway and, apart from broad-spectrum thiamine analogues, has no reported inhibitors to date. We identified thienopyrimidinone 6 as a promising initial hit against KpDXPS and conducted a structure-activity relationship (SAR) exploration to enhance potency, solubility and toxicity profiles. This effort led to the development of compounds 14 and 19, which exhibit improved solubility and reduced toxicity while maintaining inhibitory activity against KpDXPS. These findings provide a strong foundation for the development of novel anti-infective agents to address infections caused by K. pneumoniae.",

However, the 6-HB structure of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) remains unclear, hindering the development of targeted drugs. In this study, we predicted the 6-HB structure of IBV via in silico and designed an antiviral peptide HR2P based on this structure. This peptide, derived from a conserved HR2 domain identified via amino acid sequence alignment of 511 IBV strains, disrupted IBV-mediated intercellular membrane fusion. The inhibition results demonstrated that HR2P had broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against different IBV strains representing four dominant genotypes in vitro, reducing viral proliferation and replication by 100- to 1000-fold. Notably, the most potent suppression was observed against the IBV Sczy3 strain of the predominant GI-19 genotype. Meanwhile, in vivo treatment with HR2P effectively mitigated IBV infection and reduced horizontal transmission capacity, as evidenced by reduced morbidity and mortality in IBV-infected chickens and alleviated tracheal and kidney damage. Early administration of HR2P showed superior suppression efficacy. Therefore, the HR2P peptide demonstrates potential as a targeted therapeutic agent against IBV, offering a foundation for IBV prevention strategies.",

    "abstract": "The intestinal barrier is essential for maintaining mucosal homeostasis, and its dysfunction, often mediated by aberrant nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation, is closely linked to chronic inflammation. Dietary carbohydrates modulate this barrier primarily through microbial fermentation and metabolite-mediated signaling. This review synthesized current evidence on how carbohydrate structure, including degree of polymerization, branching, and chemical modifications, influenced gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) production, and NF-κB regulation. Interestingly, glycemic carbohydrates promote barrier disruption and chronic inflammation by enhancing NF-κB activation, while nonglycemic carbohydrates such as oligosaccharides, fibers, and resistant starch strengthen the gut barrier and suppress inflammatory pathways through beneficial microbiota shifts and SCFAs production. Mechanistic insights are supported by both preclinical and emerging clinical data, although human evidence remains limited and heterogeneous in the dose-response and population outcomes. The review also highlights recent advances in carbohydrate engineering, which show promise for precision modulation of the carbohydrate-microbial metabolites-NF-κB-barrier axis. Future research directions are outlined, including the development of functional carbohydrates tailored for personalized nutrition and techno-functional hybrids. These findings support dietary strategies and functional food innovations targeting carbohydrate structure to optimize gut health and reduce inflammation-driven diseases through the precise regulation of NF-κB signaling pathways.",
