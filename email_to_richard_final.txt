Subject: Final QMRA SIP Application - Marketing Task Added

Hi Richard,

Following Andrew's feedback, I've added a marketing/communications task (30 hours) to ensure the toolkit gets proper market visibility once developed. This includes collaboration with NIWA's comms team for website content and client outreach materials.

Total project hours now: 258 (Reza: 200 hrs, David: 40 hrs + review meetings)

Updated document attached: QMRA_SIP_Final_RW_Addressed_20250924_1402.docx

Ready for your sign-off when convenient.

Best regards,
Reza
