Subject: SIP Proposal: QMRA Workflow Engine Development - Review Requested

Dear Colleagues,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm pleased to share our Structured Internal Project (SIP) proposal for the development of a QMRA Workflow Engine, which I believe represents a significant strategic opportunity for NIWA.

**Project Overview:**
The proposal outlines the development of a comprehensive Python-based Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) workflow engine designed to address the urgent market demand created by the upcoming August 2025 regulatory deadline for national wastewater performance standards.

**Key Project Details:**
- Project Title: Development of QMRA Workflow Engine
- Lead Developer: Reza Moghaddam (150 hours)
- Technical Support: David Wood (40 hours - model review & documentation)
- Total Effort: 190 hours over 6 months
- Focus: Pure Python implementation for optimal performance and maintainability

**Strategic Value:**
This initiative directly addresses current operational inefficiencies that are impacting our competitive position. The workflow engine will:
- Reduce project delivery time by 60-70% (from 60-80 hours to 20-30 hours)
- Improve our competitive win rate from 60% to 80-85%
- Position NIWA as the market leader in regulatory compliance QMRA services
- Generate an estimated $100-200K additional annual revenue

**Technical Foundation:**
The solution leverages Python's mature scientific ecosystem (NumPy, SciPy, pandas) and incorporates advanced methodologies including Bayesian approaches for uncertainty quantification. The modular architecture ensures scalability and easy maintenance.

**Market Opportunity:**
With approximately 60% of treatment plants requiring consent renewals and the regulatory deadline approaching, we're facing a $25-50M market opportunity. Recent collaboration inquiries from Primary Health Foundation regarding shellfish QMRA guidance further validate the immediate demand for our enhanced capabilities.

**Next Steps:**
I would welcome your feedback and input on this proposal. The comprehensive technical specifications, work programme, and supporting research citations are detailed in the attached document.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss any aspects of the proposal in more detail.

Best regards,
