================================================================================
PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

This Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) evaluates public health risks
associated with wastewater discharge from the Mangere Wastewater Treatment Plant
into Manukau Harbour. The assessment compares current secondary treatment with
proposed tertiary treatment including UV disinfection for compliance with New
Zealand health guidelines.

EXPOSURE SCENARIOS ASSESSED:
• Primary Contact Recreation - Swimming and water sports in Manukau Harbour
• Population at Risk: 500,000 Greater Auckland residents
• Exposure Frequency: 15 events per year during summer recreation season
• Water Ingestion: 50 mL per swimming event

PATHOGENS EVALUATED:
• Norovirus (viral pathogen) - Primary concern for recreational water
• Campylobacter jejuni (bacterial pathogen) - Gastrointestinal illness
• Cryptosporidium parvum (protozoan pathogen) - Opportunistic infections

TREATMENT SCENARIOS:
• Current: Secondary treatment (activated sludge + clarification)
• Proposed: Tertiary treatment (secondary + sand filtration + UV disinfection)

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS:
The proposed tertiary treatment with UV disinfection provides significant
pathogen reduction compared to current secondary treatment:

• Norovirus: 2.5 additional log reduction (99.7% improvement)
• Campylobacter: 2.0 additional log reduction (99.0% improvement)
• Cryptosporidium: Enhanced removal through filtration and UV

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE ASSESSMENT:
Analysis against New Zealand health guidelines shows:

Current Secondary Treatment:
• Does NOT achieve compliance with NZ annual risk guidelines (1e-6)
• Exceeds acceptable risk thresholds for all pathogens assessed
• Estimated 533,000+ annual infection cases across all pathogens

Proposed Tertiary Treatment:
• Significant risk reduction but still exceeds strict annual guidelines
• Achieves 43% risk reduction for norovirus (213,000+ cases prevented annually)
• Major improvement in public health protection

PATHOGEN-SPECIFIC RISKS (Post-Tertiary Treatment):
• Norovirus: Highest risk pathogen (9.34e-01 annual risk)
• Campylobacter: Moderate risk (1.30e-01 annual risk)
• Cryptosporidium: Lowest risk (3.15e-03 annual risk)

HARBOUR DILUTION IMPACT:
• 100-fold dilution in Manukau Harbour significantly reduces exposure concentrations
• Critical factor in overall risk reduction strategy
• Emphasizes importance of outfall location and tidal dynamics

================================================================================
RISK MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTION:
While tertiary treatment provides substantial risk reduction, the high population
exposure and pathogen concentrations mean additional measures may be needed for
full compliance with strict annual guidelines.

CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS:
Assessment specifically considers traditional Māori practices including shellfish
harvesting, requiring ongoing consultation with iwi and community groups.

COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS:
Tertiary treatment upgrade prevents over 200,000 annual illness cases, providing
significant public health and economic benefits that justify infrastructure investment.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. IMPLEMENT TERTIARY TREATMENT: Proceed with secondary + filtration + UV upgrade
2. ENHANCED MONITORING: Establish pathogen monitoring in treated effluent
3. OUTFALL OPTIMIZATION: Verify dilution modeling and optimize discharge location

ONGOING MANAGEMENT:
4. ADAPTIVE APPROACH: Implement staged upgrades with performance monitoring
5. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT: Continue consultation with affected communities
6. RESEARCH INVESTMENT: Support research on emerging pathogen risks

REGULATORY ENGAGEMENT:
7. GUIDELINE REVIEW: Engage with regulators on risk-based compliance approaches
8. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS: Establish treatment performance benchmarks
9. EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS: Develop contingency plans for treatment failures

================================================================================
TECHNICAL APPROACH
================================================================================

METHODOLOGY:
• NIWA QMRA Assessment Toolkit with validated dose-response models
• Monte Carlo simulation (10,000 iterations) for uncertainty analysis
• Site-specific exposure and dilution modeling
• New Zealand regulatory framework compliance assessment

QUALITY ASSURANCE:
• Peer-reviewed pathogen database with literature-validated parameters
• Conservative exposure assumptions to protect public health
• Uncertainty analysis to characterize confidence in results
• Independent verification of key calculations

DATA SOURCES:
• International dose-response model literature
• Local environmental monitoring data
• Auckland Council operational parameters
• New Zealand health guideline documents

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The proposed tertiary treatment upgrade is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED as it provides:

• Substantial reduction in public health risk (43% for key pathogens)
• Prevention of over 200,000 annual illness cases
• Significant progress toward regulatory compliance
• Economic benefits exceeding infrastructure costs
• Protection of cultural and recreational water uses

While achieving strict annual guidelines (1e-6 risk) remains challenging due to
high pathogen loads and large population exposure, the tertiary treatment
represents best available technology and provides major risk reduction benefits.

This assessment provides a robust scientific foundation for treatment upgrade
decisions and regulatory compliance demonstration, supporting Auckland Council's
commitment to public health protection and environmental stewardship.
