## Logo

**To add the NIWA Earth Sciences logo:**

1. Save your logo image as `niwa_logo.png` in this directory
2. Recommended size: 200-400px wide, transparent background (PNG)
3. The logo will automatically appear in the web app sidebar

**Current expected file:**
- `niwa_logo.png` - NIWA Earth Sciences New Zealand logo with globe

If the logo file is not found, the app will display text branding instead.
