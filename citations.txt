There are a number of options for editing citations

To add text to the beginning of a citation (e.g. See also) use the Prefix: box
To add text to the end of a citation (e.g. to add a note, such as “emphasis added”), use the Suffix: box
To add page numbers, use the Pages: box 

There is also a Formatting drop-down, which allow you to set the Default format (Author, Year), reformat as Author (Year), Exclude author,  Exclude year, or Show Only in Bibliography

Working with Cite While You Write turned off

Particularly if you have a long document, you may be working with CWYW turned off

(info) Both methods below work with in-text or footnote citation styles

Method 1 – formatted citations

In order to edit citations as indicated above, you must first format the citations before you can edit the citations from Word’s EndNote ribbon – click the “Update Citations and Bibliography” button

Method 2 – unformatted citations

It is possible to edit unformatted citations as you would normal Word text (i.e. without using Word’s EndNote ribbon) by using the appropriate formatting

Modify an existing reference, which will appear as {Author, Year #RecordNumber} like this:

{prefix\Author, Year #RecordNumbersuffix@pages}

For example: {See also \Fang, 2012 #369 (emphasis added)@14–16}

To exclude the author, remove the name from within the { }, for example

 {, 2012 #369}

In EndNote X5 and above, you can automatically generate the Author (Year) format of in-text citation styles by adding @@author-year, for example: {Fang, 2012 #369@@author-year}
(warning) Do not delete the Author name within the { } if using @@author-year

To add a suffix with punctuation, for example specifying a chapter in an APA-style citation (Fang, 2012, Chapter 1)

{Fang, 2012 #369`, Chapter 1}
where the ` is the grave symbol, found at the top left of most keyboards

To delete the citation, just delete as you would ordinary text (Delete or Backspace key)

To Show Only in Bibliography, change the citation to

{, #RecordNumber@@hidden}
