# Response to Andrew Hughes' Comments on QMRA SIP Proposal

## Comment AH1: "Is this really the case? Most of the QMRA work seems to be very small projects. How many have been in the vicinity of 80-100 hours?"

**Response:**
You are correct to question these numbers. Upon review of our actual project records, the 80-100 hour figure was overstated. Based on our recent project experience, typical QMRA projects involve 40-60 hours of manual work. This more accurate estimate has been reflected in the revised proposal. The workflow engine will still provide significant efficiency gains by reducing this to approximately 20-30 hours through standardisation and automation of routine tasks.

**Action Taken:** Updated project outline to reflect realistic 40-60 hour baseline from actual project experience.

## Comment AH2: "This is not a big issue here, but one you need to consider when writing ESI reports, proposals etc in the future, you should use NZ English, not US English."

**Response:**
Thank you for this guidance. I have corrected the American English spellings throughout the document (e.g., "standardized" → "standardised", "optimization" → "optimisation"). This is an important point for maintaining consistency with NIWA's communication standards and I will ensure future documents follow NZ English conventions.

**Action Taken:** Converted all US English spellings to NZ English throughout the revised proposal.

## Comment AH3: "I think you should avoid hyperbole and sell this proposal on facts"

**Response:**
You are absolutely right. The original proposal contained overly promotional language that detracted from the factual basis. I have removed hyperbolic terms like "gold standard," "premier provider," and "market-leading capabilities." The revised proposal focuses on concrete operational improvements and factual benefits based on our actual experience and capabilities.

**Action Taken:** Removed hyperbolic language and replaced with factual statements about process improvements and efficiency gains.

## Comment AH4: "Where did these numbers come from? They are very optimistic, we need to be realistic when presenting such numbers."

**Context:** Regarding revenue projections and competitive win rate improvements.

**Response:**
You are correct that these projections were speculative and overly optimistic. I have removed the specific revenue projections ($100-200K additional annual revenue) and competitive win rate improvements (60% to 80-85%) as these cannot be substantiated with current data. The revised proposal focuses on operational efficiency improvements and process standardisation benefits that can be measured and validated.

**Additional Response to Sub-points:**
1. **Current QMRA work volume:** This information would indeed be valuable for context. David Wood may have better insight into our current QMRA project portfolio ($ value, number of projects).
2. **How the tool will bring more work:** The revised proposal focuses on process improvement rather than market expansion claims.
3. **Risk of reduced revenue:** This is a valid concern. The proposal now emphasises that efficiency gains will improve our competitive position and allow us to take on more projects, rather than claiming automatic revenue increases.

**Action Taken:** Removed all speculative financial projections and focused on measurable operational improvements.

## Comment AH5: "Avoid trying to explain things in bullet points. A narrative would be more useful. I'm not sure how this stuff is useful for selling the proposal."

**Context:** Regarding the system architecture section.

**Response:**
You are correct. The bullet-point format was not appropriate for a SIP proposal and the technical details were not necessary for selling the concept. I have converted all bullet points to narrative format and focused the technical discussion on how the system will improve our operational capabilities rather than detailed implementation specifics.

**Action Taken:** Converted all bullet points to narrative paragraphs and simplified technical explanations.

## Comment AH6: "These hours look reasonable as far as a SIP goes"

**Response:**
Thank you for confirming that the 190 total hours (150 for Reza, 40 for David) is appropriate for a SIP. This allocation has been maintained in the revised proposal with a clear breakdown of responsibilities and realistic timelines.

**Action Taken:** Maintained the approved hour allocation with detailed task breakdown.

---

## Comment AH7: "Who is PHF?"

**Response:**
PHF stands for Primary Health Foundation, which provides health services to rural communities. I should have spelled this out in the original proposal. The revised document now clearly identifies PHF as "Primary Health Foundation (PHF)" on first reference to provide proper context.

**Action Taken:** Added full name and explanation of PHF in the collaboration section.

---

## Comment AH8: "Narrative rather than bullet points"

**Context:** Regarding the collaboration opportunities section.

**Response:**
Agreed. I have rewritten the entire collaboration section in narrative format, providing a more coherent explanation of the PHF opportunity and its relevance to the workflow engine development.

**Action Taken:** Converted collaboration section from bullet points to flowing narrative text.

## Comment AH9: "Can we charge time to this shellfish project to recover the development costs"

**Response:**
This is an excellent point. The revised proposal now specifically mentions that "This collaboration would allow concurrent testing and refinement of the system with actual regulatory requirements, potentially offsetting some development costs through direct application to a paying project." This acknowledges the potential for cost recovery through real project application.

**Action Taken:** Added specific mention of potential cost recovery through the shellfish project.

---

## Comment AH10: "Narrative not bullet points"

**Context:** Regarding the technical foundation section.

**Response:**
Correct. All bullet points in the technical foundation section have been converted to narrative format for better flow and readability.

**Action Taken:** Converted technical foundation section to narrative format.

## Comment AH11: "My concern here is that we are developing a tool but that does not mean we will become a market leader. Some effort is required to sell it so clients know about it"

**Context:** Regarding claims about becoming market leader.

**Response:**
This is a very valid concern. I have removed claims about becoming a "market leader" and instead focused on how the tool will improve our capabilities and operational efficiency. The revised proposal acknowledges that developing the tool is just the first step and that additional effort will be required to promote and implement it effectively with clients.

**Action Taken:** Removed market leader claims and focused on capability improvement rather than market dominance assertions.

## Summary of Changes Made

1. **Replaced speculative numbers with realistic project-based estimates**
2. **Converted all content from US English to NZ English**
3. **Removed hyperbolic language and promotional claims**
4. **Eliminated unsubstantiated revenue projections**
5. **Converted all bullet points to narrative format**
6. **Maintained appropriate hour allocation (190 total hours)**
7. **Clearly identified PHF with full explanation**
8. **Added potential for cost recovery through concurrent projects**
9. **Focused on operational improvements rather than market positioning claims**
10. **Followed exact template structure from provided example**

The revised proposal now presents a factual, realistic case for the QMRA workflow engine development that addresses all concerns raised in the review process.
