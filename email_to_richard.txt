Subject: Updated QMRA SIP Application - RW Comments Addressed

Hi Richard,

Thank you for your detailed review and feedback on the QMRA SIP application. I have addressed all your comments and incorporated your suggestions into an updated version.

Key changes made based on your feedback:

• **Acronym definitions**: Added full definition of QMRA (Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment) throughout the document

• **System clarity**: Specified that @Risk security conflicts occur "within NIWA's firewall environment"

• **Software details**: Clarified that @Risk is "commercial licensed software" and emphasized that it relies on "error-prone Excel-based workflows with extensive manual processes that could be automated"

• **Language precision**: Changed "enhancing" to "developing" capabilities for accuracy

• **Context restructuring**: Moved important project context to the first paragraph as requested

• **Explicit collaboration framework**: Added a comprehensive "PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT" section that addresses your broader comment about ensuring project success, including:
  - Weekly review meetings between David and Reza after each development phase
  - Clear problem resolution protocols with escalation paths
  - Formal technical reviews at key milestones
  - Documented meetings and knowledge transfer processes

The updated document now includes a detailed timeline with specific review meeting schedules (15 review meetings total) to ensure David and Reza work together effectively with proper oversight throughout the project.

I've also strengthened the business case by emphasizing how the Python toolkit will eliminate the manual, error-prone Excel processes that currently cause quality control issues and project delays.

Please find the updated document attached: **QMRA_SIP_Final_RW_Addressed_20250924_0953.docx**

I believe this version addresses all your concerns and provides the structured collaboration approach needed to ensure project success. Please let me know if you're happy to sign off on this version.

Best regards,
Reza
