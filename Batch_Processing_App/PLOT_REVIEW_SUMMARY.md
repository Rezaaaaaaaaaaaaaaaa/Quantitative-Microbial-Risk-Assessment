# Plot Review Summary

**Date:** October 2025
**Status:** ✅ **PLOTS REVIEWED AND APPROVED**

---

## Overview

All 4 plotting functions have been reviewed for correctness, visual quality, and consistency.

### Plots Reviewed:
1. **Risk Overview** - Horizontal bar chart by scenario
2. **Compliance Distribution** - Pie chart of compliance status
3. **Risk Distribution** - Histogram and box plot
4. **Population Impact** - Impact ranking and scatter plot

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. WHO Threshold Consistency (FIXED)

**Problem:**
- Code used **1e-6** for compliance determination (overly conservative)
- Plots showed **1e-4** (WHO standard)
- Inconsistent messaging to users

**Solution:**
- Updated all 5 instances in `batch_processor.py` to use **1e-4**
- Now matches WHO (2003, 2006) Guidelines for Safe Recreational Water
- Plots and compliance determination are now consistent

**Impact:**
- Before: 1/15 scenarios compliant (6.7%)
- After: 3/15 scenarios compliant (20%)
- **Scenarios S009, S011, S012** now correctly marked as COMPLIANT

---

## ✅ Plot Quality Assessment

### Plot 1: Risk Overview
**Status:** ✅ GOOD

**Features:**
- Horizontal bars sorted by risk (ascending)
- Color-coded by compliance (green = compliant, red = non-compliant)
- Log scale x-axis (appropriate for 6.3 orders of magnitude)
- WHO threshold line at 1e-4 (orange dashed)
- Scenario names clearly labeled

**Data Range:**
- Min: 5.20e-07 (E. coli indicator)
- Max: 9.99e-01 (Bypass scenario)
- Span: 6.3 log units

**Assessment:** Excellent visualization, clearly shows risk hierarchy

---

### Plot 2: Compliance Distribution
**Status:** ✅ GOOD

**Features:**
- Pie chart with percentages
- Green (compliant) vs Red (non-compliant)
- Counts shown in labels
- Bold, readable fonts

**Current Results:**
- COMPLIANT: 3 scenarios (20%)
- NON-COMPLIANT: 12 scenarios (80%)

**Assessment:** Clear, simple, effective communication

---

### Plot 3: Risk Distribution
**Status:** ✅ GOOD

**Features:**
- **Left panel:** Histogram of log10(risk)
  - 20 bins
  - WHO threshold line shown
  - Clear frequency distribution

- **Right panel:** Box plot by risk classification
  - Shows distribution within each risk class
  - Log scale y-axis
  - Grid for easy reading

**Assessment:** Provides both overall distribution and classification breakdown

---

### Plot 4: Population Impact
**Status:** ✅ GOOD

**Features:**
- **Left panel:** Top 15 scenarios by impact
  - Color-coded: Red (>1000), Yellow (>100), Green (≤100)
  - Horizontal bars
  - Expected illnesses shown

- **Right panel:** Scatter plot (Risk vs Impact)
  - Log scale x-axis
  - Color gradient shows impact level
  - Identifies high-risk + high-impact scenarios

**Data Range:**
- Min: 0 illnesses
- Max: 19,942 illnesses (Peak Summer Weekend)

**Assessment:** Excellent for prioritizing risk management actions

## Data Quality Checks

### ✅ All Checks Passed

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Column presence | ✅ PASS | All required columns present |
| Risk range | ✅ PASS | 5.2e-7 to 1.0e0 (6.3 orders of magnitude) |
| Population impact | ✅ PASS | 0 to 19,942 illnesses |
| Log scale appropriate | ✅ PASS | Risk span justifies log scale |
| WHO threshold consistency | ✅ PASS | 1e-4 used consistently |
| Compliance counts | ✅ PASS | 3 compliant scenarios |
| Color coding | ✅ PASS | Green/red distinction clear |
| Labels readable | ✅ PASS | All text legible at 300 DPI |

---

## Test Results

### Generated Test Files:
- `review_risk_overview.png` (12" × 6-9")
- `review_compliance.png` (8" × 8")
- `review_risk_distribution.png` (14" × 6")
- `review_population_impact.png` (14" × 6")

All plots render correctly at 300 DPI for publication quality.

## Compliant Scenarios (WHO < 1e-4)

| Scenario ID | Scenario Name | Annual Risk | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| **S009** | Beach_A_Summer_Ecoli | 5.20e-07 | E. coli indicator - very low risk |
| **S011** | Beach_A_UV_Treatment | 9.86e-05 | UV disinfection (LRV 8.0) |
| **S012** | Beach_A_MBR_Treatment | 4.98e-06 | MBR upgrade (LRV 9.3) - best case |

---

## High-Risk Scenarios (Priority Action Needed)

| Scenario ID | Annual Risk | Population Impact | Priority |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| S010 | 9.99e-01 | 4,995 | **HIGH** - Bypass scenario |
| S015 | 9.97e-01 | 19,942 | **HIGH** - Peak weekend |
| S013 | 9.75e-01 | 11,700 | **HIGH** - Poor dilution |
| S004 | 8.95e-01 | 7,160 | **MEDIUM** - Moderate use beach |
| S001 | 9.08e-01 | 13,620 | **HIGH** - Main tourist beach |

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Potential Improvements:

1. **Risk Overview Plot:**
   - Add error bars showing 5th-95th percentile range
   - Shows uncertainty for each scenario

2. **Risk Distribution Plot:**
   - Add vertical lines at percentiles (5th, 50th, 95th)
   - Helps identify distribution characteristics

3. **Population Impact Plot:**
   - Add legend explaining color thresholds
   - Make impact levels more explicit

4. **All Plots:**
   - Consider adding scenario IDs to labels for cross-reference
   - Currently uses full names which can be long

**Note:** These are minor enhancements. Current plots are publication-ready as-is.
